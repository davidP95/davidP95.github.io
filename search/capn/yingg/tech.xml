	<p>The comment was made in the same week the Republican announced that he&#39;s retiring in 2018.</p>

	<h1>In general, members of Congress with high name recognition had more feedback, like House Speaker Paul Ryan.</h1>

	<h1>Not all of members of Congress show up on Google Maps though.</h1>

	<p>A Google spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in an email that in order for "business listings to appear on Google Maps or Search, users or business owners need to add the location." So the reason some lawmakers&#39; offices do not appear on Google Maps is "likely because they simply haven&#39;t been added."</p>


















 

 
	<h1>FWIW, the White House had 10,868 reviews as of Friday.</h1>

   <p><img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-11/3/15/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-15083-1509736314-3.jpg?crop=1125:1000;0,1000&resize=625:*" width="625" height="556" alt="FWIW, the White House had 10,868 reviews as of Friday." /></p>
 
	<p>You can sift through those on your own.</p>


 <p><small>Google/screenshot</small></p>
















 <p>A Google spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in an email that "Google removes reviews that violate our policy." Users can <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/4596773?hl=en">flag</a> comments they believe violate the company&#39;s <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/2622994?visit_id=1-636379840884520241-1002924966&amp;rd=2">policy</a>, which includes rules against "spam" and "off-topic reviews."</p>

<p>A US federal agency has found that Orig3n, the startup behind a controversial plan to collect football fans&rsquo; DNA, doesn&rsquo;t have the legal certification to sell genetic health tests, BuzzFeed News has learned.</p><p>Orig3n intended to give away genetic tests at a Baltimore Ravens game in September, but <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/orig3n-genetic-test-football-giveaway">axed the promotion</a> at the last minute in the face of questions from health officials. That led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to examine the tests that Orig3n sells online for as much as $149.</p><p>At the time, the agency <a href="http://baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-ravens-dna-day-20170918-story.html">said</a> it was working to determine whether Orig3n is subject to federal rules for laboratory testing of human samples. The company had privately argued that because it did not provide health information to individuals, it was exempt from those rules, known as the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).</p><p>But in an Oct. 30 letter obtained by BuzzFeed News, a CMS official told Orig3n that it is, in fact, subject to CLIA rules because some of its tests &mdash; such as those purporting to assess customers&rsquo; athletic prowess and metabolism &mdash; measure people&rsquo;s health. &ldquo;To apply for CLIA certification, Orig3n must contact both the Massachusetts and California State Agencies immediately for guidance,&rdquo; the letter said, referring to the states where Orig3n operates labs.</p><p>Orig3n&rsquo;s various tests analyze 18 genes related to health, from &ldquo;muscle power&rdquo; to &ldquo;sugar sensitivity&rdquo; to &ldquo;age-related metabolism,&rdquo; wrote Karen Dyer, a director in CMS&rsquo;s division of laboratory services, in her letter to Kate Blanchard, Orig3n&rsquo;s chief operating officer. &ldquo;It offers genetic testing that provides information for the assessment of health.&rdquo;</p><p>Blanchard told BuzzFeed News that Orig3n&rsquo;s products include 140 genes, and only 18 are subject to these federal rules. &ldquo;We have been pursuing CLIA certification for some time,&rdquo; Blanchard said in an emailed statement provided by a spokesperson. Until the company is certified, she said, Orig3n will keep selling tests that don&#39;t include those 18 genes.</p><p>&ldquo;Going forward,&rdquo; Blanchard said, &ldquo;we will continue to work with CMS, California, Massachusetts and the other states to ensure that we are meeting all federal and state regulatory requirements regarding our products.&rdquo;</p><p>The Boston startup was founded in 2014 and received $20 million in venture capital this summer. Its DNA tests have names like &ldquo;Superhero&rdquo; (&ldquo;Are you faster than a speeding bullet? Do you have the mind of a super-genius?&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Fitcode&rdquo; (&ldquo;so you can get the info you need to fine-tune your routine and reach your goals faster&rdquo;).</p><p>According to the CMS letter, Orig3n had described itself as a &ldquo;research laboratory that does not provide patient specific results.&rdquo; It claimed that its tests &ldquo;are not offered to &lsquo;patients&rsquo; but to &lsquo;customers.&rsquo;&rdquo; And its terms of service says: &ldquo;Orig3n&rsquo;s genetic tests are not diagnostic tests and cannot predict your future health. We do not provide professional medical or clinical services or advice.&rdquo;</p><p>But the agency did not find this argument convincing. CLIA regulations <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Downloads/Research-Testing-and-CLIA.pdf">set standards</a> for lab testing related to human health, such as a lab&rsquo;s procedures for collecting, analyzing, and storing samples. CLIA certification also involves getting approval from the state where a laboratory is located.</p>

<title>The Trolls Among The Toadstools In Facebook Mushroom Groups</title>

<p>Nowhere on the net is safe. The long fingers of trolling touch everything online &mdash; even an online forum that should be a sacred place for people who would rather spend their time strolling through the woods than sitting in front of a computer.</p><p>The trolls have come for the mushroom community.</p><p>On Facebook, there is a large international collective of people who are interested in mycology &mdash; foraging for and identifying mushrooms. These groups are massive by Facebook group standards: The biggest one, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/MushroomID/">The Mushroom Identification Forum</a>,&rdquo; has 111,000 members.<br /></p>

 <p><small><a rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/MushroomID/">Facebook: MushroomID</a></small></p>




<p>Like with bird-watching, you don&rsquo;t have to be a scientist or professional mycologist to become fairly capable at identification in the field. Hunting for mushrooms involves a pleasant stroll outside; it&rsquo;s something for a nature lover to do on a weekend perambulation. And if you&rsquo;re lucky, you get something delicious to bring home for dinner. It&rsquo;s the vegetarian version of deer hunting.<br /></p><p>Of course, the thing about mushrooms is, you definitely need to know exactly what species you&rsquo;re eating, or else you could literally, well, die.</p><p>For this reason, these Facebook groups are essential to budding fungi lovers. They&rsquo;re the easiest and fastest place to get advice on whether or not you&rsquo;ll shit your pants out all night from eating something.</p><p>But whenever there is an online community, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/the-alt-rights-meltdown-is-just-like-any-other-message-board#.kjLKvnw7w">there&rsquo;s drama</a>.</p><p>According to a former moderator of the Mushroom Identification Forum group &mdash; who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation &mdash; if you turn over the harmless and happy surface of the group, you find a campaign of disinformation growing like, well, a fungus.</p>











 <p>The drama started when a few of the forum&rsquo;s members colluded to play tricks on rubes and n00bs by making up fake common names for mushrooms.</p>






<p>According to the former mod, who&rsquo;s now involved with a splinter mycology group, the drama started when a few of the Forum&rsquo;s 15 mods and some seasoned foragers in the group colluded to play tricks on rubes and n00bs by making up fake common names for mushrooms. Mycologists prefer to use the scientific names, since common names can vary regionally. If you really know your stuff, you&rsquo;d say that a bright orange edible mushroom is <i>Laetiporus sulphureus</i>, not merely &ldquo;chicken of the woods.&rdquo;</p><p>The mods, along some of the experts of the group, would slyly switch words in common names when someone posted a photo asking for an ID &mdash; for example, by calling a harmless mushroom a "death angel." There is no such shroom with that name; rather, it&rsquo;s a mix of two deadly mushrooms&rsquo; names: "death cap" (<i>Amanita phalloides</i>) and "destroying angel" (<i>Amanita bisporigera</i>). To serious shroomheads, this is, apparently, a ~very funny~ joke.</p><p>The fake common-name prank took an ugly turn when a few trusted IDers in the group pretended a fungi was named &ldquo;faggot cap.&rdquo; Tim Sage, the admin of the big main group, said that moderators didn&rsquo;t ban the people who did this, but they did tell them to stop.</p><p>Other moderators admitted to BuzzFeed News that the common-name trolling took place, but they insist that it was never actually dangerous, and that they would never suggest a poisonous mushroom was safe to eat. In fact, trolls in the group did just the opposite: claiming that innocuous mushrooms were deadly or psychoactive.</p>

<p>One troll who used the name Lasse Asal (not his real name, he told me over Facebook DM) got kicked out of the group recently for doing just this. A woman posted a photo of some mushrooms she found, and Lasse immediately commented, &ldquo;those are highly poisonous i would not recommend touching them barehand.&rdquo; The fungus was never precisely identified, but the idea of poisoning through skin contact with a mushroom is purely a joke. &ldquo;I wanted to scare her,&rdquo; Lasse told me.</p><p>Mods kicked him out of the group for this post.</p>

<p>The ability to accurately identify mushrooms is hard earned. You have to spend time out in nature, you have to find the mushrooms, and you have study their scientific names. You also have to learn what mushrooms grow in which areas and what season. The impulse for these self-taught experts to laugh at rubes in mycology groups on Facebook is somewhat understandable. Mostly, they&rsquo;re not making fun of an earnest person who wants to learn. What attracts their ire are people who violate the mores of the group by doing things like posting a blurry photo of a mushroom, seeming overly eager to eat an unknown mushroom, or being stubbornly wrong about IDs.</p><p>Trolling new members or outsiders is a well-trodden path in many internet communities. Making up fake mushroom names is motivated by the same impulse that drives people on 4chan to use &ldquo;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/newfags-cant-triforce">triforce</a>&rdquo; as a litmus test (newbies can&rsquo;t figure out how to properly post three triangles onto the board). This kind of harmless trolling is how online communities establish who is in-group and solidify their sense of community. This is a kindler, gentler form of trolling than the kinds of actual abuse and harassment we associate with trolls these days.<br /></p><p>The group &ldquo;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/885613464920105/?ref=br_rs">Clueless turds who know nothing about mushrooms</a>&#33;&rdquo; is where the true mushroom experts of the main group go to make fun of the amateurs who post particularly uninformed questions or make bad IDs. This group is smaller (about 800 people) and comprises mostly screenshots of people&rsquo;s bad posts from bigger mushroom groups. There&rsquo;s also the occasional mushroom meme.</p>

<p>Jerry Dye, one of the members of Clueless Turds, explained that newbies can be irritating, and that&rsquo;s why they get trolled. &ldquo;The pranksterism seems to stem from many people posting pictures of the same species asking for IDs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take, for instance, the pheasant back mushroom. It gets posted about 10 times a day; all someone would have to do is scroll down a page or two and have their answer, yet they must ask for an ID on it anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to those searching for edible mushrooms, some people are looking for psychedelic mushrooms. These magic hunters tend to be "clueless turds" who get trolled hard; they&rsquo;re weekend warriors who don&rsquo;t care about the noble art of mycology. Similarly, there&rsquo;s a type of mushroom called chaga that is sought after for its supposed health properties. Newbies are often overly eager to find these, and it&rsquo;s become a running joke for the pros that any mushroom is chaga.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the most common troll thing to do is to say, &lsquo;Please cut your mushrooms off at ground level when harvesting and don&#39;t just tear them out,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Dan Long, one of the moderators, who in real life is the former president of the San Francisco Mycological Society. &ldquo;People get triggered and start pontificating why that is a wrong statement.&rdquo; The debate in mushroom foraging <a href="http://www.gallowaywildfoods.com/how-to-harvest-wild-mushrooms-cutting-v-picking-26711/">over cutting versus pulling is complicated</a>, but let&rsquo;s just say if you&rsquo;re an expert, you know exactly when it&rsquo;s OK to cut and when you need to pull, so telling people to always cut, for example, is misleading.</p><p>But a lot of people in these groups are entirely new to identification, so trolling this way is potentially dangerous,&rdquo; said Keiran Sunflower, one of the main group mods. &ldquo;Members are great about reporting these things and getting admins in, and we all stress absolute certainty on IDs before handling or consumption.&rdquo;</p><p>Apart from the misinformation campaigns, there&rsquo;s another vein of more garden-variety crude humor running through these groups, which tend to skew male.

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Nowhere on the net is safe. The long fingers of trolling touch everything online &#x26;mdash; even an online forum that should be a sacred place for people who would rather spend their time strolling through the woods than sitting in front of a computer.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The trolls have come for the mushroom community.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Facebook, there is a large international collective of people who are interested in mycology &#x26;mdash; foraging for and identifying mushrooms. These groups are massive by Facebook group standards: The biggest one, &#x26;ldquo;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/MushroomID/&#x22;&#x3E;The Mushroom Identification Forum&#x3C;/a&#x3E;,&#x26;rdquo; has 111,000 members.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;a rel=&#x22;nofollow&#x22;  target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;  href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/MushroomID/&#x22;&#x3E;Facebook: MushroomID&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;Like with bird-watching, you don&#x26;rsquo;t have to be a scientist or professional mycologist to become fairly capable at identification in the field. Hunting for mushrooms involves a pleasant stroll outside; it&#x26;rsquo;s something for a nature lover to do on a weekend perambulation. And if you&#x26;rsquo;re lucky, you get something delicious to bring home for dinner. It&#x26;rsquo;s the vegetarian version of deer hunting.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Of course, the thing about mushrooms is, you definitely need to know exactly what species you&#x26;rsquo;re eating, or else you could literally, well, die.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;For this reason, these Facebook groups are essential to budding fungi lovers. They&#x26;rsquo;re the easiest and fastest place to get advice on whether or not you&#x26;rsquo;ll shit your pants out all night from eating something.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But whenever there is an online community, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/the-alt-rights-meltdown-is-just-like-any-other-message-board#.kjLKvnw7w&#x22;&#x3E;there&#x26;rsquo;s drama&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;According to a former moderator of the Mushroom Identification Forum group &#x26;mdash; who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation &#x26;mdash; if you turn over the harmless and happy surface of the group, you find a campaign of disinformation growing like, well, a fungus.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;The drama started when a few of the forum&#x26;rsquo;s members colluded to play tricks on rubes and n00bs by making up fake common names for mushrooms.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;According to the former mod, who&#x26;rsquo;s now involved with a splinter mycology group, the drama started when a few of the Forum&#x26;rsquo;s 15 mods and some seasoned foragers in the group colluded to play tricks on rubes and n00bs by making up fake common names for mushrooms. Mycologists prefer to use the scientific names, since common names can vary regionally. If you really know your stuff, you&#x26;rsquo;d say that a bright orange edible mushroom is &#x3C;i&#x3E;Laetiporus sulphureus&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, not merely &#x26;ldquo;chicken of the woods.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The mods, along some of the experts of the group, would slyly switch words in common names when someone posted a photo asking for an ID &#x26;mdash; for example, by calling a harmless mushroom a &#x22;death angel.&#x22; There is no such shroom with that name; rather, it&#x26;rsquo;s a mix of two deadly mushrooms&#x26;rsquo; names: &#x22;death cap&#x22; (&#x3C;i&#x3E;Amanita phalloides&#x3C;/i&#x3E;) and &#x22;destroying angel&#x22; (&#x3C;i&#x3E;Amanita bisporigera&#x3C;/i&#x3E;). To serious shroomheads, this is, apparently, a ~very funny~ joke.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The fake common-name prank took an ugly turn when a few trusted IDers in the group pretended a fungi was named &#x26;ldquo;faggot cap.&#x26;rdquo; Tim Sage, the admin of the big main group, said that moderators didn&#x26;rsquo;t ban the people who did this, but they did tell them to stop.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Other moderators admitted to BuzzFeed News that the common-name trolling took place, but they insist that it was never actually dangerous, and that they would never suggest a poisonous mushroom was safe to eat. In fact, trolls in the group did just the opposite: claiming that innocuous mushrooms were deadly or psychoactive.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;One troll who used the name Lasse Asal (not his real name, he told me over Facebook DM) got kicked out of the group recently for doing just this. A woman posted a photo of some mushrooms she found, and Lasse immediately commented, &#x26;ldquo;those are highly poisonous i would not recommend touching them barehand.&#x26;rdquo; The fungus was never precisely identified, but the idea of poisoning through skin contact with a mushroom is purely a joke. &#x26;ldquo;I wanted to scare her,&#x26;rdquo; Lasse told me.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Mods kicked him out of the group for this post.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;The ability to accurately identify mushrooms is hard earned. You have to spend time out in nature, you have to find the mushrooms, and you have study their scientific names. You also have to learn what mushrooms grow in which areas and what season. The impulse for these self-taught experts to laugh at rubes in mycology groups on Facebook is somewhat understandable. Mostly, they&#x26;rsquo;re not making fun of an earnest person who wants to learn. What attracts their ire are people who violate the mores of the group by doing things like posting a blurry photo of a mushroom, seeming overly eager to eat an unknown mushroom, or being stubbornly wrong about IDs.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Trolling new members or outsiders is a well-trodden path in many internet communities. Making up fake mushroom names is motivated by the same impulse that drives people on 4chan to use &#x26;ldquo;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/newfags-cant-triforce&#x22;&#x3E;triforce&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x26;rdquo; as a litmus test (newbies can&#x26;rsquo;t figure out how to properly post three triangles onto the board). This kind of harmless trolling is how online communities establish who is in-group and solidify their sense of community. This is a kindler, gentler form of trolling than the kinds of actual abuse and harassment we associate with trolls these days.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The group &#x26;ldquo;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/885613464920105/?ref=br_rs&#x22;&#x3E;Clueless turds who know nothing about mushrooms&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x26;#33;&#x26;rdquo; is where the true mushroom experts of the main group go to make fun of the amateurs who post particularly uninformed questions or make bad IDs.

<p>The president&#8217;s personal account was abruptly taken offline for 11 minutes Thursday. Twitter says a customer support employee deactivated the account.</p>

 <p>The suspension of Trump&#39;s account suggests Twitter employees have access to the company&#39;s most prominent accounts. </p>

<p>A former senior employee told BuzzFeed News that "a lot" of employees have the ability to suspend a user&#39;s account and that fewer, in the hundreds, can deactivate one. The former employee described the system like a dashboard, meaning employees might not need engineering skills to suspend or deactivate an account. </p>

<p>"It&#39;s one click if you have the rights to access the tool," the person said.</p>

<p>The source noted that Twitter was aware that its suspension permissions could be abused but did not change its protocol. </p>

<p>"There was discussion that for verified accounts or high profile ones, there&#39;d be special protections (i.e. "2 keys") but it was never implemented," the person said.</p>

<title>Twitter Offered Russian Television Network RT 15% Of Its Total Share Of US Elections Advertising</title>

<p>Twitter wanted RT to spend big ahead of the 2016 US election, offering a significant portion of its election-related ad inventory in return. The social media company offered the Russian state&ndash;owned television network up to a 15% share of voice ("SOV") on US election advertising &mdash; or the percent of all ads run on that topic &mdash; for $3 million.</p><p>RT&#39;s share of voice was 2% at the time of the pitch, according to a June 2016 email from a Twitter sales executive to RT staff members that RT shared with BuzzFeed News. The $3 million spent would multiply RT&#39;s share of voice more than sevenfold, but still leave it short of CNN&#39;s 56% and FOX&#39;s 32%. RT declined the offer.</p><p>"We do not have any comment on our private conversations with any advertiser, even a former advertiser," a Twitter spokesperson said. Twitter did not dispute the email&rsquo;s validity.<br /></p><p>After courting RT&#39;s ad dollars during the 2016 election, Twitter reversed course last week when it said it would prohibit accounts owned by the network from advertising on its platform: "This decision was based on the retrospective work we&#39;ve been doing around the 2016 U.S. election and <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf">the U.S. intelligence community&rsquo;s conclusion</a> that both RT and Sputnik attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government."</p><p>The intelligence report Twitter referenced called RT "the Kremlin&rsquo;s principal international propaganda outlet."</p><p>Both the Russian government and WikiLeaks played important roles in the 2016 US presidential election. WikiLeaks published a trove of hacked emails from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, and top Clinton adviser John Podesta. Russia-backed hackers are <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hayesbrown/how-russia-hacked-obamas-legacy?utm_term=.hsR2LEdLV#.aiWg4bQ4R">suspected</a> of illegally obtaining and handing over those emails. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/thomasfrank/manafort-indictment-didnt-mention-russian-collusion-but?utm_term=.dj5D3253m#.mv6nml3ma">currently investigating</a> members of the Trump campaign for possible collusion with the Russian government during the campaign. And the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency tried to influence the election and sow discord in its aftermath via a widespread campaign on social media.</p><p>At an open Senate hearing Tuesday, Twitter, Facebook, and Google were pressed for answers on why they didn&#39;t see Russian election meddling taking place inside their platforms. "I want to understand why no one seems to have caught on to the Russian effort earlier," Minnesota Sen. Al Franken said at the hearing.</p><p>All confessed their shortcomings, adding they were making fixes. Twitter&#39;s testimony explicitly noted the "off-boarding" of RT&#39;s accounts from its ad platform. And RT came up in both the Senate and House Intelligence Committee hearings dealing with Russian interference Wednesday.</p><p>RT may no longer be a Twitter customer now, as the company made clear at the hearings, but not long ago it was a multimillion-dollar sales prospect.</p>

Twitter&#x26;#39;s testimony explicitly noted the &#x22;off-boarding&#x22; of RT&#x26;#39;s accounts from its ad platform. And RT came up in both the Senate and House Intelligence Committee hearings dealing with Russian interference Wednesday.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;RT may no longer be a Twitter customer now, as the company made clear at the hearings, but not long ago it was a multimillion-dollar sales prospect.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p>For the past two days, representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter testified before Congress in the hope of stopping the momentum of the spiraling crisis narrative: that their platforms allowed foreign governments to sow political discord and spread disinformation that may have influenced the outcome of a US presidential election. The appearance was billed as a chance for tech&rsquo;s biggest companies to share information and tell their side of the story.</p><p>Instead, the platforms&rsquo; lawyers stumbled through the hearings offering few clear explanations for their failure to detect past interference while dodging pointed questions with semantics. In their attempts to cauterize their post-election wounds, the platforms opened up new ones, demonstrating their continued susceptibility to future attacks on US democracy. By sending no-name employees, rather than anyone from the upper echelons of the business &mdash; who then dodged tough questions and gave the impression that they are <i>still</i> unprepared for another round of foreign meddling &mdash; tech squandered any opportunity at a quick redemption narrative. As such, it&rsquo;s hard to see Big Tech&rsquo;s march on Washington as anything other than a spectacular stumble.</p><p>Repeatedly throughout their testimony, Facebook, Twitter, and Google somberly recognized the gravity of their post-election situation. &ldquo;We think this is a huge deal,&rdquo; Facebook&rsquo;s general counsel Colin Stretch assured the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Tuesday afternoon during a particularly tense line of questioning. And yet the platforms&#39; chief executives left the defense of their companies to their lawyers. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was in New York City this week showing off a new cash register. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook&rsquo;s CEO, was at a photo op in China. Google co-founder Larry Page&rsquo;s whereabouts were less obvious, but he certainly wasn&rsquo;t in either the House or Senate testifying.</p>











 <p>"You have a huge problem on your hands. ... You created these platforms ... and now they&rsquo;re being misused." </p>






<p>Their absence was glaring &mdash; and befuddling given the CEOs&rsquo; boundless enthusiasm for self-aggrandizing magazine covers and celebratory keynotes. A congressional hearing is perhaps the opposite of a Forbes cover, as oil and tobacco industry executives will likely attest, but the the failure of Big Tech&rsquo;s most famous executives to attend a hearing on a matter of national security may well read to critics as proof of one of the platforms&rsquo; biggest vulnerabilities: that Silicon Valley&rsquo;s leadership is unwilling to take ownership of its missteps.

Lawmakers used their stage to repeatedly savage Facebook, Google, and Twitter&rsquo;s representatives for their inadequate responses. With a vast audience watching, senators teed up aggressive lines of yes or no questioning virtually guaranteed to go viral. &ldquo;Are you satisfied with your platform&#39;s response to the election?&rdquo; Sen. Ron Wyden asked each representative. After a long, uncomfortable silence they all responded in agreement. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While such grandstanding is common practice in congressional hearings, its cumulative effect is particularly humbling for Facebook, Twitter, and Google, which looked increasingly less like multibillion-dollar titans of industry and much more like children who&rsquo;d phoned in a school report.<br /></p>











 <p>"We don&#39;t have state-sponsored manipulation of elections as part of our rules." </p>






<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you get it,&rdquo; Sen. Dianne Feinstein lectured the companies at one point on Wednesday afternoon. &ldquo;We are not going away, gentlemen. And this is a very big deal. I went home last night with profound disappointment. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers. And that just won&rsquo;t do. You have a huge problem on your hands. ... You created these platforms ... and now they&rsquo;re being misused. And you have to be the ones who do something about it &mdash; or we will.&rdquo;</p><p>When it came time to answer crucial questions, the companies were rarely in a position to provide satisfactory explanations. When asked Tuesday if they had the ability to know each and every one of their advertisers, Facebook deflected with an answer about &ldquo;authenticity,&rdquo; implying that the content of foreign posts was less of a problem than the users shielding their identities. Twitter, meanwhile was forced to acknowledge it had a problem identifying shell companies trying to use ads on its platform. On Wednesday when Sen. Marco Rubio inquired as to whether foreign interference is a violation of the platform&rsquo;s terms of service, Twitter&rsquo;s acting general counsel Sean Edgett could not argue that it was. "We don&#39;t have state-sponsored manipulation of elections as part of our rules," he said.</p>

<p>On issues of ad targeting, Facebook evaded substantive questions with semantic dodges. Asked by Sen. John Kennedy if the company could target users on either emotional or individual levels, Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch repeatedly wriggled out of a direct answer. When Kennedy asked hypothetically if CEO Mark Zuckerberg could use Facebook&rsquo;s overwhelming data set to gather information on a particular individual for surveillance purposes, Stretch denied it. &ldquo;The answer is absolutely not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have limitations in place on our ability [to access this information].&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking about your rules,&rdquo; interrupted Kennedy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying you have the ability to do that, don&rsquo;t you? You can&rsquo;t put a name to a face to a piece of data? You&rsquo;re telling me that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have designed our systems to prevent exactly that, to protect the privacy of our users,&rdquo; Stretch replied.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your testimony under oath?&rdquo; asked Kennedy.</p><p>That exchange is, in many ways, a perfect representation of the unprecedented situation in which the platforms currently find themselves. Their massive scale makes it difficult to adequately answer pointed questions &mdash; because of the complexity and opacity of the algorithmic systems, and because of their vast audiences, which could never be comprehensively policed by humans alone. The unprecedented scope of companies like Google and Facebook &mdash; their size, the personal information they&rsquo;ve amassed and their centrality in our society &mdash; creates a profound disconnect with those that use them. As Sen. John Cornyn <a href="https://twitter.com/Kantrowitz/status/925757135040012290">noted with exasperation</a> toward the end of Wednesday&rsquo;s morning hearings, for every complex problem caused by the platforms, there&#39;s a clear, simple and wrong answer.</p><p>It&rsquo;s this disconnect that was so prominently on display this week in Washington. You could hear it in the scolding tone of the questions and in the stammering, stunted replies of the general counsels (and acting general counsels, in Twitter&rsquo;s case), rendering almost every question from lawmakers facile in the eyes of the tech companies and almost every response inadequate in the eyes of the lawmakers.</p><p>There&rsquo;s history, here, too. One former senior Twitter employee described the relationship between DC and Twitter in deeply unflattering terms, dating back to the 2013 Snowden revelations. &ldquo;Lately, there&rsquo;s this line between the tech companies and the government that &#39;we&#39;re not friends, we&#39;re enemies,&#39;&rdquo; this person told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;That&#39;s lead to this general lack of candor because informal company policy at Twitter has largely been &#39;when Congress calls, say fuck you.&#39;&rdquo;</p><p>Even attempts to find common ground during the hearing seemed tempered with hearty skepticism. &ldquo;I think you do enormous good. But your power sometimes scares me,&rdquo; Senator Kennedy told the three companies Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>For Facebook, Twitter, and Google, the conflict of enormous good and frightening power are nothing new. This week, Silicon Valley came to DC in the hopes of changing the narrative around that power &mdash; namely that it can harness it for the better. But it seems likely to leave it having convinced few of the idea. Worse, it&#39;s made it clear that even after years of press releases, corporate slogans, and lobbying, the major tech companies don&#39;t know how to talk about their power without making people uneasy.</p><p>And those no-show CEOs? It increasingly <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lissandravilla/some-senate-investigators-say-they-now-want-to-hear?utm_term=.lkaq6Dyge#.upApA7EeM">looks like they&rsquo;ll eventually have to turn up</a> anyway.</p>

 <p><small>Pinterest</small></p>




<p>This kind of misinformation is baseless and ineffective at best, and harmful at worst &mdash; some pins, for example, make unsubstantiated claims about preventing and treating cancer &mdash; but Pinterest says that it is only a minor problem for the site.</p><p>With little effort over the past month, BuzzFeed News found more than a dozen misleading health-related pins that were being shared widely.</p><p>One pin, saved to about 13,000 boards, falsely claimed: "Even Doctors Can Not Explain This: Boiled Cinnamon And Honey Is The Cure For Many Health Problems,&rdquo; from cancer to arthritis to gallbladder infections. Another pin with a bogus claim &mdash; "Retired Pharmacy Chief Said: &#39;The World Needs To Know, Alkaline Water Kills Cancer&#39;&rdquo; &mdash; was saved to more than 16,500 boards.</p>

<p>One pin, saved to 16,000 boards, suggested in its title that &ldquo;vitamin B17&rdquo; could be a &ldquo;cancer treatment.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s a nickname for a chemical compound that is not an officially recognized vitamin and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/apricot-seeds-cancer">does not cure cancer</a>. In fact, large doses can generate dangerous or even fatal levels of cyanide.</p><p>The title of <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/785667097465942032/">yet another pin</a> claimed that genetically modified foods are &ldquo;Linked to Tumors, Allergies and Early Death,&rdquo; which is not supported by scientific evidence. It was saved to about 15,000 boards.</p><p>Some of the dozen or so false or misleading health pins that BuzzFeed News found were removed after we contacted Pinterest and the authors of the pins for comment. Pinterest said that it took action on the pins that violated its terms of service.</p><p>Misinformation on Pinterest isn&rsquo;t just limited to health advice: Earlier this month, <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/10/11/how-russian-content-ended-up-on-pinterest/">the Washington Post</a> also reported that the site had been flooded with political content created by Russian operatives in an attempt to sway the 2016 election.</p><p>Adelin Cai, head of policy at Pinterest, told BuzzFeed News that a &ldquo;small volume&rdquo; of medical misinformation exists on the platform, although she did not know what percentage of the overall content it comprised.</p><p>&ldquo;We have so much content on the platform. It&rsquo;s curated by millions of people across a variety of categories,&rdquo; Cai said. &ldquo;Sometimes those ideas might be controversial or cause some public concern, or they just might not be for everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>She added, &ldquo;At the end of the day, what we&rsquo;re really concerned with is making Pinterest a really safe place so people can find and discover the things they really love.&rdquo;</p>

 <p><small>Pinterest</small></p>




<p>Pinterest largely relies on users to report problematic content, Cai said.<br /></p><p>Pinners can report individual pins by clicking on them and selecting from reasons like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see this,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is spam,&rdquo; and &ldquo;This goes against Pinterest&rsquo;s guidelines.&rdquo; From there, Cai&rsquo;s team can decide whether to delete a pin or make it &ldquo;undiscoverable,&rdquo; which means that it still exists on a person&rsquo;s board but that other users cannot search for it.</p><p>In its guidelines for community posters, Pinterest <a href="https://policy.pinterest.com/en-gb/community-guidelines">says</a> it removes content that &ldquo;promotes harmful behavior.&rdquo;</p><p>One type of that content is &ldquo;medical misinformation.&rdquo; The company says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take action on content spreading medical misinformation that could lead to serious harm to Pinners &mdash; for example, claims of curing diseases currently considered by the medical community to be incurable.&rdquo; Cai said in an interview that this list includes cancer and epilepsy. (She added that advertisers are not allowed to promote medical misinformation.)</p><p>But Pinterest&rsquo;s definition of medical misinformation overlooks other forms of unsubstantiated health information.</p>











 

 
	<h1>One <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/313985405262879600/">pin</a>, for example, linked to a raw apple cider vinegar recipe, claiming it could cure urinary tract infections.</h1>

   <p><img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-10/27/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-24462-1509129823-14.png" width="545" height="740" alt="One pin, for example, linked to a raw apple cider vinegar recipe, claiming it could cure urinary tract infections." /></p>
 
	


 <p><small>Pinterest</small></p>




<p>In the text of the pin, the author claimed, &ldquo;Find out how to get rid of bladder infections naturally&#33; Yes, without a doctor and without antibiotics&#33; It is easy and really works&#33;&rdquo; Although home remedies can help ease the discomfort of UTIs, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353453">most effective</a> line of treatment is antibiotics, and letting UTIs go <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/more-like-u-t-why?utm_term=.kuPd6KaKv#.wfRWzrpr0">untreated</a> can lead to more severe kidney infections.<br /></p><p>Dina Marie Oswald, who runs myculturedpalate.com, defended that recipe to BuzzFeed News, saying that people should try natural remedies before resorting to traditional medicine. "There&rsquo;s nothing on My Cultured Palate that I have not personally used," she said. "These are things that really work."</p><p>A different pin <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/785667097465942062/">claimed</a> that genetically modified foods &ldquo;have not been proven safe,&rdquo; even though <a href="https://nas-sites.org/ge-crops/2016/05/16/report-in-brief/">studies have overall concluded</a> that they are as inherently safe as conventional foods. Both pins are still up.</p><p>&ldquo;When content comes to us, we will consider it and see whether we consider it appropriate for the platform or not,&rdquo; Cai said, when presented with these types of examples. &ldquo;We make tweaks internally and publish things externally if we change our policies.&rdquo;</p>

 <p><small>Pinterest</small></p>




<p>Some of the people who&rsquo;ve made these misleading health pins admit that the claims they make aren&rsquo;t always valid.<br /></p><p>Josh Axe, who runs the natural health website draxe.com, is a self-described &ldquo;doctor of natural medicine, doctor of chiropractic and clinical nutritionist with a passion to help people get healthy by using food as medicine.&rdquo; Infographics that the site posted on Pinterest, and linked back to his website, suggested that &ldquo;vitamin B17&rdquo; is a potential &ldquo;cancer treatment&rdquo; and that <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/785667097465942032/">genetically modified food</a> is linked to leukemia, liver toxicity, kidney failure, and gut inflammation.</p><p>A draxe.com spokesperson said its team had removed the pins after BuzzFeed News inquired about them. &ldquo;Some articles on our site are older and don&#39;t contain the rigorous, accurate research that we&#39;ve become known for,&rdquo; spokesperson Alex Loria said by email. &ldquo;The GMO and the &lsquo;Vitamin B17&rsquo; articles you point to are both faulty in some respects and have been taken down while they are reworked.&rdquo;</p><p>And Anne-Marie Nichols, a lifestyle and recipe blogger in Georgia, has pinned the popular infographic that <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/785667097465942062/">claims</a> that genetically modified food is not safe &mdash; even though she says she no longer believes that&rsquo;s true.<br /></p>

 <p><small>Pinterest / Via <a rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/785667097465942062/">pinterest.com</a></small></p>




<p>Nichols told BuzzFeed News she posted the infographic, which was supplied to her by an outside company, on her Pinterest and her blog, This Mama Cooks, three to four years ago.</p><p>She&rsquo;s since deleted it from her blog, but it&rsquo;s still on her Pinterest, where it&rsquo;s been shared on more than 26,000 other boards. Nichols said that she has pinned thousands of images over the years &mdash; sometimes the same image multiple times in an effort to get pinners&rsquo; eyeballs on it and drive traffic back to her blog, which is a common practice on the platform, she said. With Pinterest&rsquo;s user interface, it&rsquo;s hard even for her to find her own content.</p><p>&ldquo;These boards are so gigantic, I couldn&rsquo;t go find it without scrolling and scrolling and scrolling,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Some users say that even though Pinterest is an increasingly difficult place to capture people&rsquo;s attention, the website referral traffic is still too significant to be ignored. Health pins can help drive that traffic.</p><p>For example, a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/313985405262879628/">pin</a> containing a juice recipe to cure a UTI &ldquo;without antibiotics&rdquo; has been saved to 37,000 boards. It was created by Lee Traister, who says Pinterest is her top source of traffic to her site <a href="https://ladyleeshome.com">ladyleeshome.com</a>.</p><p>Traister told BuzzFeed News that Pinterest generates about 50% of the 50,000 to 70,000 monthly page views she gets on her site dedicated to homestead living. &ldquo;I also post regularly on Facebook,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But Pinterest is by far the greatest for bloggers in this niche as far as traffic goes.&rdquo;</p><p>Asked about the scientific basis for the claim that her juice recipe can cure a UTI, Traister said that a lot of commenters have said the recipe worked for them. But &ldquo;every person is going to have to decide for themselves what they want to try,&rdquo; she said.</p>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some of the people who&#x26;rsquo;ve made these misleading health pins admit that the claims they make aren&#x26;rsquo;t always valid.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Josh Axe, who runs the natural health website draxe.com, is a self-described &#x26;ldquo;doctor of natural medicine, doctor of chiropractic and clinical nutritionist with a passion to help people get healthy by using food as medicine.&#x26;rdquo; Infographics that the site posted on Pinterest, and linked back to his website, suggested that &#x26;ldquo;vitamin B17&#x26;rdquo; is a potential &#x26;ldquo;cancer treatment&#x26;rdquo; and that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/785667097465942032/&#x22;&#x3E;genetically modified food&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is linked to leukemia, liver toxicity, kidney failure, and gut inflammation.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;A draxe.com spokesperson said its team had removed the pins after BuzzFeed News inquired about them. &#x26;ldquo;Some articles on our site are older and don&#x26;#39;t contain the rigorous, accurate research that we&#x26;#39;ve become known for,&#x26;rdquo; spokesperson Alex Loria said by email. &#x26;ldquo;The GMO and the &#x26;lsquo;Vitamin B17&#x26;rsquo; articles you point to are both faulty in some respects and have been taken down while they are reworked.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;And Anne-Marie Nichols, a lifestyle and recipe blogger in Georgia, has pinned the popular infographic that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/785667097465942062/&#x22;&#x3E;claims&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that genetically modified food is not safe &#x26;mdash; even though she says she no longer believes that&#x26;rsquo;s true.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Pinterest / Via &#x3C;a rel=&#x22;nofollow&#x22;  target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;  href=&#x22;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/785667097465942062/&#x22;&#x3E;pinterest.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;Nichols told BuzzFeed News she posted the infographic, which was supplied to her by an outside company, on her Pinterest and her blog, This Mama Cooks, three to four years ago.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;She&#x26;rsquo;s since deleted it from her blog, but it&#x26;rsquo;s still on her Pinterest, where it&#x26;rsquo;s been shared on more than 26,000 other boards. Nichols said that she has pinned thousands of images over the years &#x26;mdash; sometimes the same image multiple times in an effort to get pinners&#x26;rsquo; eyeballs on it and drive traffic back to her blog, which is a common practice on the platform, she said. With Pinterest&#x26;rsquo;s user interface, it&#x26;rsquo;s hard even for her to find her own content.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;These boards are so gigantic, I couldn&#x26;rsquo;t go find it without scrolling and scrolling and scrolling,&#x26;rdquo; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some users say that even though Pinterest is an increasingly difficult place to capture people&#x26;rsquo;s attention, the website referral traffic is still too significant to be ignored. Health pins can help drive that traffic.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;For example, a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/313985405262879628/&#x22;&#x3E;pin&#x3C;/a&#x3E; containing a juice recipe to cure a UTI &#x26;ldquo;without antibiotics&#x26;rdquo; has been saved to 37,000 boards. It was created by Lee Traister, who says Pinterest is her top source of traffic to her site &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://ladyleeshome.com&#x22;&#x3E;ladyleeshome.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Traister told BuzzFeed News that Pinterest generates about 50% of the 50,000 to 70,000 monthly page views she gets on her site dedicated to homestead living. &#x26;ldquo;I also post regularly on Facebook,&#x26;rdquo; she said. &#x26;ldquo;But Pinterest is by far the greatest for bloggers in this niche as far as traffic goes.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Asked about the scientific basis for the claim that her juice recipe can cure a UTI, Traister said that a lot of commenters have said the recipe worked for them. But &#x26;ldquo;every person is going to have to decide for themselves what they want to try,&#x26;rdquo; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p>The House Intelligence Committee released a sampling of the Facebook ads and posts linked to a Russian troll operation during and after the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Facebook <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/facebook-now-says-146-million-people-in-us-were-reached-by?utm_term=.jnXEnNPeD#.inD9PrYWy">told senators</a> earlier Wednesday that the ads on its platform and on Instagram had reached 146 million people, again revising up its estimate of how many users had been reached by posts connected to the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm with ties to the Russian government.</p>

	<p>This post on the Russia-linked "Blacktivist" page went up on Oct. 10, 2016, a month before the election.</p>


 <p><small>Facebook / House Intelligence Committee / Via <a rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/hpsci-11-1/hpsci-minority-open-hearing-exhibits.htm">democrats-intelligence.house.gov</a></small></p>




<p>You can view all 32 of the ads and posts from the Russia-linked accounts <a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/hpsci-11-1/hpsci-minority-open-hearing-exhibits.htm">here</a> and <a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/hpsci-11-1/">here</a>, along with metadata describing how the ads were targeted and when the posts went up.<br /></p><p>The committee also released the names of <a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/exhibit_b.pdf">some Twitter accounts</a> that were linked to the targeting.</p><p>The ads were released during the House committee&#39;s open hearing with representatives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google on how their platforms were used by Russia to interfere in last year&#39;s election. The committee is led by Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and Rep. Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican, who has led the committee&#39;s Russia probe since Chairman Devin Nunes stepped aside from the investigation.</p><p>Facebook has previously said a portion of the ads were targeted by location. In at least one case, an ad <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/media/facebook-black-lives-matter-targeting/index.html">referencing</a> Black Lives Matter was targeted toward people in Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, which have both seen violent clashes in recent years following the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police.<br /></p><p>Facebook <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/">revealed</a> in early September that fake accounts and pages linked to Russia spent approximately $100,000 on political ads during and after the last presidential campaign. Most of the ads, Facebook said, didn&#39;t necessarily mention specific candidates. "Rather, the ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum &mdash; touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights," Facebook said.</p><p>Facebook subsequently turned over the more than 3,000 Russian-linked ads to congressional committees investigating interference in the 2016 campaign.</p><p>While the Senate Intelligence Committee has maintained it has no plans of releasing the ads, the Conaway and Schiff <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/technology/lawmakers-say-they-plan-to-release-facebook-ads-linked-to-russia.html?_r=0">said</a> in October that they were working with Facebook to delete personal information from the ads, with the aim of releasing them publicly after the hearings in both the Senate and House Intelligence committees with representatives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google.</p><p>It is illegal for foreign entities to make contributions in US elections, but a lack of rules around online political advertising means the Russian ad activity could go mostly undetected. In the Senate, three senators have <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/senators-are-pushing-a-bill-to-combat-russia-linked?utm_term=.baNdArW16#.ftMe6p5ma">introduced</a> a bill that would increase transparency around ads on Facebook and other websites. Facebook has also <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/heres-how-facebook-will-soon-let-you-see-who-paid-for?utm_term=.quMl9PJoz#.kh4eWv5Al">announced</a> measures to increase transparency around paid political ads.</p>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;You can view all 32 of the ads and posts from the Russia-linked accounts &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/hpsci-11-1/hpsci-minority-open-hearing-exhibits.htm&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/hpsci-11-1/&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, along with metadata describing how the ads were targeted and when the posts went up.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The committee also released the names of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/exhibit_b.pdf&#x22;&#x3E;some Twitter accounts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that were linked to the targeting.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The ads were released during the House committee&#x26;#39;s open hearing with representatives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google on how their platforms were used by Russia to interfere in last year&#x26;#39;s election. The committee is led by Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and Rep. Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican, who has led the committee&#x26;#39;s Russia probe since Chairman Devin Nunes stepped aside from the investigation.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Facebook has previously said a portion of the ads were targeted by location. In at least one case, an ad &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/media/facebook-black-lives-matter-targeting/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;referencing&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Black Lives Matter was targeted toward people in Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, which have both seen violent clashes in recent years following the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Facebook &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/&#x22;&#x3E;revealed&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in early September that fake accounts and pages linked to Russia spent approximately $100,000 on political ads during and after the last presidential campaign. Most of the ads, Facebook said, didn&#x26;#39;t necessarily mention specific candidates. &#x22;Rather, the ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum &#x26;mdash; touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights,&#x22; Facebook said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Facebook subsequently turned over the more than 3,000 Russian-linked ads to congressional committees investigating interference in the 2016 campaign.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;While the Senate Intelligence Committee has maintained it has no plans of releasing the ads, the Conaway and Schiff &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/technology/lawmakers-say-they-plan-to-release-facebook-ads-linked-to-russia.html?_r=0&#x22;&#x3E;said&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in October that they were working with Facebook to delete personal information from the ads, with the aim of releasing them publicly after the hearings in both the Senate and House Intelligence committees with representatives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It is illegal for foreign entities to make contributions in US elections, but a lack of rules around online political advertising means the Russian ad activity could go mostly undetected. In the Senate, three senators have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/senators-are-pushing-a-bill-to-combat-russia-linked?utm_term=.baNdArW16#.ftMe6p5ma&#x22;&#x3E;introduced&#x3C;/a&#x3E; a bill that would increase transparency around ads on Facebook and other websites. Facebook has also &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/heres-how-facebook-will-soon-let-you-see-who-paid-for?utm_term=.quMl9PJoz#.kh4eWv5Al&#x22;&#x3E;announced&#x3C;/a&#x3E; measures to increase transparency around paid political ads.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p>Several Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee want to hear directly from the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google, following a frequently tense hearing with lawyers from the companies on Wednesday that they said offered few satisfying answers about Russia&rsquo;s use of their platforms to influence US politics and how they&rsquo;ll prevent foreign interference in the future.</p><p>Both during and after the hearing Wednesday, Democrats on the committee said they will make the push to hear from the CEOs &mdash; Twitter&rsquo;s Jack Dorsey, Facebook&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg and Google&rsquo;s Sundar Pichai &mdash; in the near future.</p><p>Independent Sen.

Ron Wyden said after after he left the hearing that he wants to hear from the CEOs themselves because he was disappointed in the answers members received Wednesday. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get any specifics when I asked them what they were going to do to promote real changes, so I feel very strongly about this,&rdquo; Wyden said.</p><p>Asked when he would want the CEOs to come in, Wyden said, &ldquo;as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>The committee&rsquo;s leaders, however, are still considering whether dragging the CEOs in for follow-up testimony is the right move.</p><p>Virginia Sen.

Dianne Feinstein said. &ldquo;The question comes, for me, I represent them, I&rsquo;d like very much to sit down with the CEO and, you know, have a conversation about this.&rdquo;</p><p>Feinstein noted, however, that she thought the counsels had given better answers at Wednesday&rsquo;s Intelligence hearing than at a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/social-media-platforms-make-their-liabilities-clear-in">Judiciary committee hearing</a> she attended the day before.</p><p>While Republicans on the committee haven&rsquo;t expressed a strong desire to hear directly from the CEOs, they also have not shut down the idea.</p><p>Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, a Republican, argued that the committee wasn&rsquo;t likely to get different answers from CEOs than from the general counsel.</p><p>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t matter to me one way or the other,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The CEOs will talk to their counsel on any statement that they&rsquo;re going to make anyway, so getting a direct access to their counsel I think is also helpful, either one, to be able to communicate the position of the company I think is fine.&rdquo;</p>

Dianne Feinstein said. &#x26;ldquo;The question comes, for me, I represent them, I&#x26;rsquo;d like very much to sit down with the CEO and, you know, have a conversation about this.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Feinstein noted, however, that she thought the counsels had given better answers at Wednesday&#x26;rsquo;s Intelligence hearing than at a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/social-media-platforms-make-their-liabilities-clear-in&#x22;&#x3E;Judiciary committee hearing&#x3C;/a&#x3E; she attended the day before.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;While Republicans on the committee haven&#x26;rsquo;t expressed a strong desire to hear directly from the CEOs, they also have not shut down the idea.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, a Republican, argued that the committee wasn&#x26;rsquo;t likely to get different answers from CEOs than from the general counsel.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;It really doesn&#x26;rsquo;t matter to me one way or the other,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;The CEOs will talk to their counsel on any statement that they&#x26;rsquo;re going to make anyway, so getting a direct access to their counsel I think is also helpful, either one, to be able to communicate the position of the company I think is fine.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p>In a Capitol Hill hearing Tuesday afternoon, lawyers from Facebook, Google and Twitter testified under oath about Russian manipulation of their platforms during the 2016 election. The lawyers confessed their companies&rsquo; shortcomings, promised fixes, and told senators they were taking the issue extremely, extremely seriously.</p><p>But while delivering these statements, they did something else even more critical: they made clear how susceptible their companies are to future attacks on US democracy.</p><p>Throughout the hearing, the companies struggled to persuade senators that they could effectively monitor platforms of their size. Facebook was hammered by Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, a freshman Republican, in a series of questions about whether it can effectively monitor the 5 million advertisers spending money on the platform each month.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get us down from &lsquo;lala land,&rsquo;&rdquo; Kennedy said. &ldquo;The truth of the matter is you have 5 million advertisers, they change every month, every minute, probably every second &mdash; you don&rsquo;t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>In describing their policies, the platforms didn&rsquo;t bear much better with senators&rsquo; questions.</p><p>Foreign agents using their real names on Facebook can try to cause chaos as long as they&rsquo;re acting within Facebook&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/">rules</a>, Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch&rsquo;s testimony revealed. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so much the content &mdash; although to be clear much of that content is offensive and has no place on Facebook &mdash; but the real problem with what we saw was its lack of authenticity,&rdquo; Stretch said. If Kremlin agents used real accounts and abide by the platform&rsquo;s rules, that implied, they could go ahead and post away.</p><p>In its testimony, Twitter made clear it doesn&rsquo;t have a good response to block shell companies looking to manipulate elections from advertising on its platform. When Democratic Sen.

<title>People Are Freaking Out That iPhones Categorize &#x22;Brassiere&#x22; Pics</title>

<p>When I tested this, it did find photos of me wearing a bra (don&rsquo;t @ me, they were mostly all photos of my stomach when I was pregnant). It also found some photos of people wearing tank tops and a dress with spaghetti straps &mdash; I guess that makes sense; a robot scanning for markers would visually identify those kinds of things as a &ldquo;brassiere.&rdquo; There were a few other misfires: my friend in her strapless wedding dress, and a group of women in matching crop tops and shorts from a competitive wing-eating event. It also found a photo I took of my elbow when it got a weird infection:<br /></p>

<p>If you start typing into your iPhone&#39;s photo search, you&rsquo;ll see it suggests all sorts of categories that it is using to organize your photos.

If they&rsquo;re teaching their image recognition to scan as many types of photos as possible, it makes sense to teach them to recognize items of clothing.

<title>Square Launched A New Cashless Register</title>

 <p><small>Square</small></p>




<p>Square just introduced a <a href="https://squareup.com/hardware/register?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvuDPBRDnARIsAGhuAmbhbHtmZgU0zSscFJvqqTnfwlFNGu1fEcpkCEIXWN368hJOkZW8nt8aAp-tEALw_wcB&amp;pcrid=229911045284&amp;pdv=c&amp;pkw=square+register&amp;pmt=e">full-on cash register (without cash)</a> that&rsquo;s a more robust version of the little white reader you&rsquo;ve probably seen at coffee shops and farmer&rsquo;s markets. The register has a touch screen for the cashier, and a second screen for the customer to see their bill being rung up. That means in the near future, the barista at the coffee shop won&rsquo;t have to turn the iPad for you to sign after taking your order.</p><p>Square launched its new product at a pop-up shop for merchandise from the record label <a href="https://txdxe.com/">TDE (Top Dawg Entertainment)</a>, which releases music from Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q, SZA, and more.

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Square&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;Square just introduced a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://squareup.com/hardware/register?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvuDPBRDnARIsAGhuAmbhbHtmZgU0zSscFJvqqTnfwlFNGu1fEcpkCEIXWN368hJOkZW8nt8aAp-tEALw_wcB&#x26;amp;pcrid=229911045284&#x26;amp;pdv=c&#x26;amp;pkw=square+register&#x26;amp;pmt=e&#x22;&#x3E;full-on cash register (without cash)&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that&#x26;rsquo;s a more robust version of the little white reader you&#x26;rsquo;ve probably seen at coffee shops and farmer&#x26;rsquo;s markets. The register has a touch screen for the cashier, and a second screen for the customer to see their bill being rung up. That means in the near future, the barista at the coffee shop won&#x26;rsquo;t have to turn the iPad for you to sign after taking your order.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Square launched its new product at a pop-up shop for merchandise from the record label &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://txdxe.com/&#x22;&#x3E;TDE (Top Dawg Entertainment)&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, which releases music from Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q, SZA, and more. Jack Dorsey, dual CEO of both Square and Twitter, sat down with BuzzFeed News at the event.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Compared to Dorsey&#x26;rsquo;s other company, Twitter, which is dealing with drama about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/twitter-will-end-dark-ads-and-establish-a-transparency&#x22;&#x3E;Russian troll farms on its platform&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and its Gordian knot of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/twitter-is-still-dismissing-harassment-reports-and?utm_term=.hgl3n28N69#.wq6oO4Bam3&#x22;&#x3E;harassment policies&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, Square is doing great. Its stock price is strong, and its payment processor has gone from novelty to ubiquitous.

<p>Employees have filed multiple lawsuits against Kreation, and across these suits, failure to pay overtime is the most common complaint. But Kreation employees also allege they weren&rsquo;t paid for missed breaks, didn&rsquo;t get paid sick time, and, in one case, were harassed and threatened at knifepoint on the job for being gay.<br /></p><p>In an email statement to BuzzFeed News, Kreation founder Marjan Sarshar wrote, &ldquo;Kreation, as a team, values our employees as our family. We value all people from all walks of life, and we give all employees the opportunity to grow within the company. Kreation is aware of the Kaputsos lawsuit&mdash;a lawsuit titled a class action, but filed by one former employee claiming to act on behalf of others he does not represent. Those issues will be tried and decided in court later, where Kreation will continue to defend against the claims. In the meantime, as always, Kreation will continue to ensure its employees are treated justly and fairly.&rdquo;</p><p>Asked to elaborate on specific allegations made by current and former employees, especially pertaining to missed overtime pay, Sarshar declined to comment further.</p><p>In December 2016, a Kreation employee named Marshall Kaputsos, who worked as a host and server in-store at various Kreation locations, filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, as well as Sarshar, and her business partner, Farzin Madjidi. In the suit, which is currently pending in LA County Superior Court, Kaputsos says he&rsquo;s seeking back wages for unpaid overtime (he alleges he sometimes worked more than 14 hours a day), uncompensated breaks, and unpaid sick time.</p><p>According to Kaputsos&rsquo;s lawsuit, Sarshar used Kreation&rsquo;s multiple business locations to conceal the fact that Kaputsos was working overtime and to avoid having to pay higher wages in accordance with California law. From the suit:</p>

<p>For example, during the pay period starting May 9, 2016 and ending May 22, 2016, Plaintiff received one paycheck from &ldquo;Kreation Organics Inc.&rdquo; to compensate him for 80 hours of work at his base rate of pay, which was $10/hour (minimum wage). For the exact same pay period, Plaintiff received another paycheck from &ldquo;Kreation &amp; 1023 Montana Inc.&rdquo; to compensate him for an additional 9.27 hours of work at $10/hour. Even though the pay stubs plainly show that Plaintiff worked at least 9.27 hours of overtime during this pay period, there is no overtime compensation reflected on either pay stub.</p>

<p>Kaputsos also alleges that he was asked to stay at Kreation locations until 2 or 3 a.m. preparing for pest exterminators, and that on the occasion of one cockroach infestation, Kreation &ldquo;required servers to stay late and deep clean the restaurant&rdquo; but never paid them. The potential class, which hasn&rsquo;t yet been certified by a judge, is estimated to be more than 200 individuals.</p><p>According to court filings, Kaputsos&#39;s and Kreation&rsquo;s lawyers attempted to reach a settlement agreement via mediation over the summer. But last week, Kaputsos&rsquo;s lawyers filed an amended complaint, moving ahead toward a trial. The next hearing in the suit is scheduled for December.</p><p>&ldquo;I never got paid overtime,&rdquo; a former Kreation employee who is not involved in any legal action against Kreation, and asked to remain anonymous, told BuzzFeed News via private message. &ldquo;I got those hours on a separate check from the juicery, which, I never worked there. I only worked in the restaurant. So when I would do overtime I got to [<i>sic</i>] separate checks one for 80 hrs and another one for the overtime hrs at same minimum wage.&rdquo;</p><p>A second anonymous employee gave a similar account, telling BuzzFeed News, &ldquo;There are a lot of people who do work overtime, but they just pay them two different checks instead of overtime and change the location of the store.&rdquo;</p><p>Other workers have filed suit against Kreation independently. Donnie Ramos, who used the same <a href="http://www.teuklaw.com/about.html">law firm</a> as Kaputsos did, filed his suit in March this year. In his complaint, Ramos says he repeatedly brought up the issue of overtime pay with his supervisors at Kreation, but never received any. His suit alleges the same multi-address pay stub scheme that Kaputsos&rsquo;s describes.</p><p>But according to his lawsuit, Ramos&rsquo;s real problems at work started when a kitchen supervisor started harassing him for being gay. Ramos alleges that the harassment took place over a seven-month period, beginning with name-calling (&ldquo;faggot,&rdquo; &ldquo;fucking <i>puto</i>,&rdquo; etc), escalating to aggression (&ldquo;Panchito whipped him with a wet towel on his buttocks&rdquo;), and then, allegedly, assault. From the lawsuit:</p>

<p>On Saturday, November 5, 2016, Mr. Ramos was in the kitchen with Panchito and another cook. Panchito looked at Mr. Ramos and said aggressively, &ldquo;What do you want, puta?&rdquo; Before Mr. Ramos could respond, Panchito grabbed a chef&rsquo;s knife with a long blade and held it out threateningly towards Mr. Ramos. He said, &ldquo;Get the fuck out of here, I am going to kill you because you are a faggot,&rdquo; or words to that effect.</p>

<p>Ramos says he reported his coworker&rsquo;s harassment and threats of violence to his supervisors at Kreation multiple times between February and November, but they didn&rsquo;t take action. Following the knife-wielding incident in November 2016, Ramos says Kreation fired him (his suit includes a wrongful termination claim). According to his lawsuit, Ramos picked up a knife in self-defense during the altercation; Kreation later filed a petition for a restraining order against him, which was dismissed. Ramos&rsquo;s own suit, which claims he experienced harassment in a hostile work environment and discrimination based on sexual orientation, in addition to lost pay and wrongful termination, is pending in LA County Superior Court.</p><p>In June, Kreation&rsquo;s lawyers filed an answer to Ramos&rsquo;s complaint, in which they denied &ldquo;each and every allegation&rdquo; he made against the company. His trial is currently scheduled for February.</p><p>Other workers have also sued the company in the past. An employee named Juan Romero filed a suit against Kreation in 2014, alleging that he wasn&rsquo;t paid overtime, despite working for Kreation between 60 and 70 hours a week. That case was dismissed by request of the worker&rsquo;s attorneys in August 2015.</p><p>Marjan Sarshar, who says she started the Kreation brand with a Santa Monica caf&eacute; in 2007, has faced legal troubles before. Her financial backer, Farzin Madjidi, filed suit against her in November 2016, alleging that she had duped him, using a secondary company, Bebegol Inc., to cut him out of the business. He says they&rsquo;d agreed to split the profits from any Kreation stores or projects he helped fund 50-50. Sarshar filed a countercomplaint vehemently denying these allegations in April. The trial is currently scheduled for February.</p><p>In 2005, Sarshar and her husband were arrested following a police investigation into an LA opium ring; Sarshar&rsquo;s husband, Mehrdad Lari, who was allegedly the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/28/local/me-opium28">&ldquo;boss&rdquo; of the ring</a>, pleaded guilty to some charges and was sentenced to four years in prison. Sarshar was not charged.</p><p>Despite these struggles, Sarshar has successfully built Kreation into a <a href="https://la.eater.com/maps/juice-bar-map-los-angeles-guide-update">popular</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-juice-bars-20130615-story.html">brand</a> in LA. Celebrities are frequently photographed holding or buying Kreation products; some <a href="https://twitter.com/BusyPhilipps/status/854397626493444096]">tweet</a> about how much they like them. Kreation was even <a href="http://goop.com/specialty/california/los-angeles/brentwood/kreation-juicery/">highlighted</a> on Gwyneth Paltrow&rsquo;s lifestyle website, Goop.</p>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Employees have filed multiple lawsuits against Kreation, and across these suits, failure to pay overtime is the most common complaint. But Kreation employees also allege they weren&#x26;rsquo;t paid for missed breaks, didn&#x26;rsquo;t get paid sick time, and, in one case, were harassed and threatened at knifepoint on the job for being gay.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In an email statement to BuzzFeed News, Kreation founder Marjan Sarshar wrote, &#x26;ldquo;Kreation, as a team, values our employees as our family. We value all people from all walks of life, and we give all employees the opportunity to grow within the company. Kreation is aware of the Kaputsos lawsuit&#x26;mdash;a lawsuit titled a class action, but filed by one former employee claiming to act on behalf of others he does not represent. Those issues will be tried and decided in court later, where Kreation will continue to defend against the claims. In the meantime, as always, Kreation will continue to ensure its employees are treated justly and fairly.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Asked to elaborate on specific allegations made by current and former employees, especially pertaining to missed overtime pay, Sarshar declined to comment further.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In December 2016, a Kreation employee named Marshall Kaputsos, who worked as a host and server in-store at various Kreation locations, filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, as well as Sarshar, and her business partner, Farzin Madjidi. In the suit, which is currently pending in LA County Superior Court, Kaputsos says he&#x26;rsquo;s seeking back wages for unpaid overtime (he alleges he sometimes worked more than 14 hours a day), uncompensated breaks, and unpaid sick time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;According to Kaputsos&#x26;rsquo;s lawsuit, Sarshar used Kreation&#x26;rsquo;s multiple business locations to conceal the fact that Kaputsos was working overtime and to avoid having to pay higher wages in accordance with California law. From the suit:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;For example, during the pay period starting May 9, 2016 and ending May 22, 2016, Plaintiff received one paycheck from &#x26;ldquo;Kreation Organics Inc.&#x26;rdquo; to compensate him for 80 hours of work at his base rate of pay, which was $10/hour (minimum wage). For the exact same pay period, Plaintiff received another paycheck from &#x26;ldquo;Kreation &#x26;amp; 1023 Montana Inc.&#x26;rdquo; to compensate him for an additional 9.27 hours of work at $10/hour. Even though the pay stubs plainly show that Plaintiff worked at least 9.27 hours of overtime during this pay period, there is no overtime compensation reflected on either pay stub.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kaputsos also alleges that he was asked to stay at Kreation locations until 2 or 3 a.m. preparing for pest exterminators, and that on the occasion of one cockroach infestation, Kreation &#x26;ldquo;required servers to stay late and deep clean the restaurant&#x26;rdquo; but never paid them. The potential class, which hasn&#x26;rsquo;t yet been certified by a judge, is estimated to be more than 200 individuals.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;According to court filings, Kaputsos&#x26;#39;s and Kreation&#x26;rsquo;s lawyers attempted to reach a settlement agreement via mediation over the summer. But last week, Kaputsos&#x26;rsquo;s lawyers filed an amended complaint, moving ahead toward a trial. The next hearing in the suit is scheduled for December.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I never got paid overtime,&#x26;rdquo; a former Kreation employee who is not involved in any legal action against Kreation, and asked to remain anonymous, told BuzzFeed News via private message. &#x26;ldquo;I got those hours on a separate check from the juicery, which, I never worked there. I only worked in the restaurant. So when I would do overtime I got to [&#x3C;i&#x3E;sic&#x3C;/i&#x3E;] separate checks one for 80 hrs and another one for the overtime hrs at same minimum wage.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;A second anonymous employee gave a similar account, telling BuzzFeed News, &#x26;ldquo;There are a lot of people who do work overtime, but they just pay them two different checks instead of overtime and change the location of the store.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Other workers have filed suit against Kreation independently. Donnie Ramos, who used the same &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.teuklaw.com/about.html&#x22;&#x3E;law firm&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as Kaputsos did, filed his suit in March this year. In his complaint, Ramos says he repeatedly brought up the issue of overtime pay with his supervisors at Kreation, but never received any. His suit alleges the same multi-address pay stub scheme that Kaputsos&#x26;rsquo;s describes.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But according to his lawsuit, Ramos&#x26;rsquo;s real problems at work started when a kitchen supervisor started harassing him for being gay. Ramos alleges that the harassment took place over a seven-month period, beginning with name-calling (&#x26;ldquo;faggot,&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;ldquo;fucking &#x3C;i&#x3E;puto&#x3C;/i&#x3E;,&#x26;rdquo; etc), escalating to aggression (&#x26;ldquo;Panchito whipped him with a wet towel on his buttocks&#x26;rdquo;), and then, allegedly, assault. From the lawsuit:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Saturday, November 5, 2016, Mr. Ramos was in the kitchen with Panchito and another cook. Panchito looked at Mr. Ramos and said aggressively, &#x26;ldquo;What do you want, puta?&#x26;rdquo; Before Mr. Ramos could respond, Panchito grabbed a chef&#x26;rsquo;s knife with a long blade and held it out threateningly towards Mr. Ramos. He said, &#x26;ldquo;Get the fuck out of here, I am going to kill you because you are a faggot,&#x26;rdquo; or words to that effect.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Ramos says he reported his coworker&#x26;rsquo;s harassment and threats of violence to his supervisors at Kreation multiple times between February and November, but they didn&#x26;rsquo;t take action. Following the knife-wielding incident in November 2016, Ramos says Kreation fired him (his suit includes a wrongful termination claim). According to his lawsuit, Ramos picked up a knife in self-defense during the altercation; Kreation later filed a petition for a restraining order against him, which was dismissed. Ramos&#x26;rsquo;s own suit, which claims he experienced harassment in a hostile work environment and discrimination based on sexual orientation, in addition to lost pay and wrongful termination, is pending in LA County Superior Court.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In June, Kreation&#x26;rsquo;s lawyers filed an answer to Ramos&#x26;rsquo;s complaint, in which they denied &#x26;ldquo;each and every allegation&#x26;rdquo; he made against the company. His trial is currently scheduled for February.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Other workers have also sued the company in the past. An employee named Juan Romero filed a suit against Kreation in 2014, alleging that he wasn&#x26;rsquo;t paid overtime, despite working for Kreation between 60 and 70 hours a week. That case was dismissed by request of the worker&#x26;rsquo;s attorneys in August 2015.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Marjan Sarshar, who says she started the Kreation brand with a Santa Monica caf&#x26;eacute; in 2007, has faced legal troubles before. Her financial backer, Farzin Madjidi, filed suit against her in November 2016, alleging that she had duped him, using a secondary company, Bebegol Inc., to cut him out of the business. He says they&#x26;rsquo;d agreed to split the profits from any Kreation stores or projects he helped fund 50-50. Sarshar filed a countercomplaint vehemently denying these allegations in April. The trial is currently scheduled for February.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In 2005, Sarshar and her husband were arrested following a police investigation into an LA opium ring; Sarshar&#x26;rsquo;s husband, Mehrdad Lari, who was allegedly the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/28/local/me-opium28&#x22;&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;boss&#x26;rdquo; of the ring&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, pleaded guilty to some charges and was sentenced to four years in prison. Sarshar was not charged.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Despite these struggles, Sarshar has successfully built Kreation into a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://la.eater.com/maps/juice-bar-map-los-angeles-guide-update&#x22;&#x3E;popular&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-juice-bars-20130615-story.html&#x22;&#x3E;brand&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in LA. Celebrities are frequently photographed holding or buying Kreation products; some &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/BusyPhilipps/status/854397626493444096]&#x22;&#x3E;tweet&#x3C;/a&#x3E; about how much they like them. Kreation was even &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://goop.com/specialty/california/los-angeles/brentwood/kreation-juicery/&#x22;&#x3E;highlighted&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on Gwyneth Paltrow&#x26;rsquo;s lifestyle website, Goop.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p>Facebook&#39;s admission that a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin used its ad platform to interfere with the 2016 presidential election doesn&#39;t seem to be troubling the company&#39;s advertisers. According to new data obtained by BuzzFeed News, ad spends on Facebook are on the rise despite <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/facebooks-nightmare-scenario-is-unfolding-in-washington?utm_term=.nfAAdz1OMm#.eqnzNdGpnB">the unprecedented crisis</a> that has erupted around <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/how-people-inside-facebook-are-reacting-to-the-companys">the company&rsquo;s role in the Russian ad scandal</a>. Meanwhile, some advertising industry executives are touting the episode as a testament to just how effective Facebook advertising can be.</p><p>&ldquo;The discovery of Russian ads on Facebook intended to influence the US election is not a major concern for brand advertisers,&rdquo; Aaron Goldman, chief marketing officer of the media technology company 4C Insights, told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;If anything, it&rsquo;s just another case study that ads on Facebook can be highly effective.&rdquo;</p>











 <p>&ldquo;For better or worse, one key takeaway from this is how effective Facebook can be as an advertising medium.&rdquo;</p>






<p>&ldquo;For better or worse, one key takeaway from this is how effective Facebook can be as an advertising medium,&rdquo; Kyle Bunch, managing director of ad agency R/GA&rsquo;s social practice, told BuzzFeed News. "Many advertisers are probably asking themselves, &lsquo;How can I make better use of data to have my campaigns get those kind of results?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Total Facebook ad spending has increased during the crisis, according to data from 4C, which is on track to run $1 billion in social ad spending this year. &ldquo;For the quarter ended September 30th, we saw a 27% increase in ad spend on Facebook versus the previous quarter across 350 advertisers using our platform,&rdquo; Goldman said. &ldquo;We also saw increases in CPM (cost per thousand) and CPC (cost per click) which means that advertisers are willing to pay more for each ad.&rdquo; In October, spending is up 20% compared to the first month of the previous quarter, Goldman said.</p><p>There are clear reasons for this, of course. Facebook is still an extremely effective ad platform &mdash; it&rsquo;s used by so many people that omitting it from advertising plans would be irresponsible in many cases. But more than anything else, advertisers simply don&rsquo;t feel that Facebook&rsquo;s role in 2016&#39;s unexpected election outcome has any bearing on their business.</p><p>&ldquo;People are spending most of their mobile time in Facebook and/or Instagram feeds,&rdquo; Jill Sherman, senior vice president of social strategy at the ad agency DigitasLBi, told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;To think that moving money elsewhere is the answer for advertisers is akin to saying that audience doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore, and that&rsquo;s just not the case.&rdquo;</p>











 <p>&ldquo;It was eye opening for some people that questioned the validity of ads in social platforms.&rdquo;</p>






<p>Sherman said she&rsquo;s heard positive chatter about Facebook&rsquo;s effectiveness among some in the ad industry. And indeed, reports of how effective the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency&rsquo;s $100,000 spend was are almost doing Facebook&rsquo;s sales team&#39;s jobs for them. Some fanciful <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/michigan-could-have-swung-in-the-2016-election-for-just-42800-2017-10">headlines</a> have claimed that the entire state of Michigan could&rsquo;ve been swayed with $42,000. And even without those reports, Facebook&rsquo;s admission that the $100,000 ad buy reached 10 million people is pretty impressive to many.</p><p>&ldquo;It was eye opening for some people that questioned the validity of ads in social platforms,&rdquo; Sherman said.</p><p>Laura O&#39;Shaughnessy, CEO of SocialCode &mdash; a social advertising company that works with major brands such as Heineken and Visa &mdash; told BuzzFeed News that Facebook&rsquo;s Russia ads crisis hasn&rsquo;t been a client concern. &ldquo;In all the meetings I&rsquo;m in, which is a lot, this has not come up,&rdquo; O&#39;Shaughnessy said. &ldquo;It does not affect the utility and how essential these digital platforms are.&rdquo;</p><p>Mike Racic, president of media services at the digital ad agency iCrossing, echoed that sentiment. &ldquo;In the short term, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll see advertisers moving away from Facebook if they are still getting the kind of results they want from their ad spends,&rdquo; he told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;At worst, you&rsquo;ll likely find CMO types or their agencies answering more questions from management, who sometimes react to headlines.&rdquo;</p><p>While Facebook isn&rsquo;t facing short-term revenue consequences over the scandal, the company&rsquo;s failure to catch the Russian ad buy could contribute to a growing credibility issue with advertising clients who worry the platform isn&rsquo;t fully aware of what&rsquo;s happening inside its walls. A number of advertisers interviewed by BuzzFeed News expressed concern over a <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/2017/01/31/facebook-defends-metrics-errors/">recent</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-it-found-more-miscalculated-metrics-1479303984">series</a> of Facebook <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-overestimated-key-video-metric-for-two-years-1474586951">metrics errors</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything that challenges their credibility shouldn&rsquo;t be taken lightly,&rdquo; Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group, told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;All of the trust issues add friction. And friction slows the pace of growth.&rdquo;</p><p>This week, Facebook&#39;s representatives are in Washington, D.C. for three public hearings with congressional committees to discuss Russia&rsquo;s attempt to influence last year&rsquo;s US presidential election. Advertisers seem to prefer that Facebook take care of its issues on its own. They want it to figure out a way to effectively self-regulate as opposed to leaving it in the government&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the platform in and of itself is problematic. I think that Facebook simply needs to figure out the right balance of self-governance,&rdquo; DigitasLBi&rsquo;s Sherman said. &ldquo;I would hate for a third party to come in and slow the process down and make the buy more expensive and less efficient.&rdquo;</p><p>On Wednesday, the same day Facebook meets with the House and Senate intelligence committees to discuss Russian manipulation of its platform, it will also report its third-quarter earnings. As the company works to defuse a crisis in Washington, its business will likely look just fine to the bankers in New York.</p>

And indeed, reports of how effective the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency&#x26;rsquo;s $100,000 spend was are almost doing Facebook&#x26;rsquo;s sales team&#x26;#39;s jobs for them. Some fanciful &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.businessinsider.com/michigan-could-have-swung-in-the-2016-election-for-just-42800-2017-10&#x22;&#x3E;headlines&#x3C;/a&#x3E; have claimed that the entire state of Michigan could&#x26;rsquo;ve been swayed with $42,000. And even without those reports, Facebook&#x26;rsquo;s admission that the $100,000 ad buy reached 10 million people is pretty impressive to many.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;It was eye opening for some people that questioned the validity of ads in social platforms,&#x26;rdquo; Sherman said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Laura O&#x26;#39;Shaughnessy, CEO of SocialCode &#x26;mdash; a social advertising company that works with major brands such as Heineken and Visa &#x26;mdash; told BuzzFeed News that Facebook&#x26;rsquo;s Russia ads crisis hasn&#x26;rsquo;t been a client concern. &#x26;ldquo;In all the meetings I&#x26;rsquo;m in, which is a lot, this has not come up,&#x26;rdquo; O&#x26;#39;Shaughnessy said. &#x26;ldquo;It does not affect the utility and how essential these digital platforms are.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Mike Racic, president of media services at the digital ad agency iCrossing, echoed that sentiment. &#x26;ldquo;In the short term, I don&#x26;rsquo;t think you&#x26;rsquo;ll see advertisers moving away from Facebook if they are still getting the kind of results they want from their ad spends,&#x26;rdquo; he told BuzzFeed News. &#x26;ldquo;At worst, you&#x26;rsquo;ll likely find CMO types or their agencies answering more questions from management, who sometimes react to headlines.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;While Facebook isn&#x26;rsquo;t facing short-term revenue consequences over the scandal, the company&#x26;rsquo;s failure to catch the Russian ad buy could contribute to a growing credibility issue with advertising clients who worry the platform isn&#x26;rsquo;t fully aware of what&#x26;rsquo;s happening inside its walls. A number of advertisers interviewed by BuzzFeed News expressed concern over a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.marketingweek.com/2017/01/31/facebook-defends-metrics-errors/&#x22;&#x3E;recent&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-it-found-more-miscalculated-metrics-1479303984&#x22;&#x3E;series&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of Facebook &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-overestimated-key-video-metric-for-two-years-1474586951&#x22;&#x3E;metrics errors&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Anything that challenges their credibility shouldn&#x26;rsquo;t be taken lightly,&#x26;rdquo; Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group, told BuzzFeed News. &#x26;ldquo;All of the trust issues add friction. And friction slows the pace of growth.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;This week, Facebook&#x26;#39;s representatives are in Washington, D.C. for three public hearings with congressional committees to discuss Russia&#x26;rsquo;s attempt to influence last year&#x26;rsquo;s US presidential election. Advertisers seem to prefer that Facebook take care of its issues on its own. They want it to figure out a way to effectively self-regulate as opposed to leaving it in the government&#x26;rsquo;s hands. &#x26;ldquo;I don&#x26;rsquo;t think the platform in and of itself is problematic. I think that Facebook simply needs to figure out the right balance of self-governance,&#x26;rdquo; DigitasLBi&#x26;rsquo;s Sherman said. &#x26;ldquo;I would hate for a third party to come in and slow the process down and make the buy more expensive and less efficient.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Wednesday, the same day Facebook meets with the House and Senate intelligence committees to discuss Russian manipulation of its platform, it will also report its third-quarter earnings. As the company works to defuse a crisis in Washington, its business will likely look just fine to the bankers in New York.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;


 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>Russian Trolls Posted On Facebook 80,000 Times In An Effort To Cause Chaos In The US</title>

 <p><small>Dado Ruvic / Reuters</small></p>




<p>A whopping 126 million people using Facebook in the US could&#39;ve been exposed to 80,000 posts created by a Kremlin-linked entity seeking to disrupt the 2016 US presidential election and sow discord in its aftermath, according <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2017/10/30/4509587e-bd84-11e7-97d9-bdab5a0ab381_story.html?pushid=59f7a1634069751d0000002f&amp;tid=notifi_push_breaking-news&amp;utm_term=.72e54f655962">reports</a> Monday.<br /></p><p>The number is vastly higher than the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/facebook-says-10-million-people-saw-russia-purchased?utm_term=.or72wqo97J#.hfav1q2zax">10 million people Facebook initially said</a> were exposed to content created by the entity &mdash; called the Internet Research Agency &mdash; though that number referred only to its paid posts.<br /></p><p>This revelation about the Internet Research Agency&#39;s vast reach comes as Facebook prepares to testify in open hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees Wednesday about Russia&#39;s manipulation of its platform. Facebook will also appear before the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to discuss similar issues.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>The days leading to the hearings have been turbulent for Facebook, which twice updated its statement about the <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/10/hard-questions-russian-ads-delivered-to-congress/">reach</a> of the Russian ads.</p><p>Google and Twitter will testify at the hearings this week too, and both companies will provide new details, according to a Google blog post on Monday and reports of Twitter&#39;s testimony.</p><p>Google&#39;s post detailed that it had found &ldquo;some evidence of efforts to misuse&rdquo; its platforms by accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, including 18 channels that uploaded 1,108 videos to YouTube. In its findings, Google said the content was viewed 309,000 times in the US between June 2015 and November 2016, and that the videos were not targeted to the US or any particular segment of the population.</p><p>Google said it suspended those 18 accounts for violations of its terms of service, but did not disclose what kind of content lead to those suspensions.</p><p>While the search giant has been under less scrutiny than Facebook and Twitter, it has still faced backlash for its role in hosting the videos from Russia Today, a Russian state-backed news network that a federal intelligence report identified as a primary tool in Kremlin propaganda efforts. Google said it &#x200B;&ldquo;found &#x200B;no &#x200B;evidence &#x200B;of &#x200B;manipulation &#x200B;of &#x200B;our &#x200B;platform &#x200B;or policy &#x200B;violations&rdquo; from RT. Still, earlier this summer, Google removed RT from a premium group of outlets on YouTube that brands could advertise on. At the time, Google gave no explanation for RT&rsquo;s removal from that premium package.</p><p>Google also said that it found two accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency that spent $4,700 on its ad platforms, covering both search and display ads, during the election cycle. Those ads, according to the company, were not targeted to users&rsquo; geography or political preferences. The company also disclosed that it found evidence of Gmail accounts associated with Internet Research Agency&#39;s campaign being used to open accounts on other platforms. Google did not say how many Gmail accounts were associated with these activities.</p><p>Twitter, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2017/10/30/4509587e-bd84-11e7-97d9-bdab5a0ab381_story.html?pushid=59f7a1634069751d0000002f&amp;tid=notifi_push_breaking-news&amp;utm_term=.c1622312d5c9">reports</a> of its planned testimony, said it found more than 2,752 accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency, a significant increase from the approximately 200 it had initially reported. Twitter&rsquo;s initial presentation of that number drew <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/charliewarzel/twitter-russian-accounts">harsh criticism</a> from Senate Intelligence Committee vice chair Senator Mark Warner, who called it "frankly inadequate on almost every level."</p><p>Twitter declined to comment.</p><p>This week will be a pivotal week for all three companies as they seek to show Congress that they now have their platforms under control after the Russians exploited them during and after the 2016 election season. So far, lawmakers are proving to be a <a href="https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/923603455469551616">difficult sell</a> &mdash; and Silicon Valley&#39;s <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/facebooks-nightmare-scenario-is-unfolding-in-washington?utm_term=.hmdWvmlv0#.fwg27aA79">crisis in Washington</a> may just be beginning.</p>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;A whopping 126 million people using Facebook in the US could&#x26;#39;ve been exposed to 80,000 posts created by a Kremlin-linked entity seeking to disrupt the 2016 US presidential election and sow discord in its aftermath, according &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html&#x22;&#x3E;multiple&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2017/10/30/4509587e-bd84-11e7-97d9-bdab5a0ab381_story.html?pushid=59f7a1634069751d0000002f&#x26;amp;tid=notifi_push_breaking-news&#x26;amp;utm_term=.72e54f655962&#x22;&#x3E;reports&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Monday.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The number is vastly higher than the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/facebook-says-10-million-people-saw-russia-purchased?utm_term=.or72wqo97J#.hfav1q2zax&#x22;&#x3E;10 million people Facebook initially said&#x3C;/a&#x3E; were exposed to content created by the entity &#x26;mdash; called the Internet Research Agency &#x26;mdash; though that number referred only to its paid posts.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;This revelation about the Internet Research Agency&#x26;#39;s vast reach comes as Facebook prepares to testify in open hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees Wednesday about Russia&#x26;#39;s manipulation of its platform. Facebook will also appear before the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to discuss similar issues.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Facebook declined to comment.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The days leading to the hearings have been turbulent for Facebook, which twice updated its statement about the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/10/hard-questions-russian-ads-delivered-to-congress/&#x22;&#x3E;reach&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the Russian ads.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Google and Twitter will testify at the hearings this week too, and both companies will provide new details, according to a Google blog post on Monday and reports of Twitter&#x26;#39;s testimony.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Google&#x26;#39;s post detailed that it had found &#x26;ldquo;some evidence of efforts to misuse&#x26;rdquo; its platforms by accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, including 18 channels that uploaded 1,108 videos to YouTube. In its findings, Google said the content was viewed 309,000 times in the US between June 2015 and November 2016, and that the videos were not targeted to the US or any particular segment of the population.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Google said it suspended those 18 accounts for violations of its terms of service, but did not disclose what kind of content lead to those suspensions.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;While the search giant has been under less scrutiny than Facebook and Twitter, it has still faced backlash for its role in hosting the videos from Russia Today, a Russian state-backed news network that a federal intelligence report identified as a primary tool in Kremlin propaganda efforts. Google said it &#x26;#x200B;&#x26;ldquo;found &#x26;#x200B;no &#x26;#x200B;evidence &#x26;#x200B;of &#x26;#x200B;manipulation &#x26;#x200B;of &#x26;#x200B;our &#x26;#x200B;platform &#x26;#x200B;or policy &#x26;#x200B;violations&#x26;rdquo; from RT. Still, earlier this summer, Google removed RT from a premium group of outlets on YouTube that brands could advertise on. At the time, Google gave no explanation for RT&#x26;rsquo;s removal from that premium package.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Google also said that it found two accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency that spent $4,700 on its ad platforms, covering both search and display ads, during the election cycle. Those ads, according to the company, were not targeted to users&#x26;rsquo; geography or political preferences. The company also disclosed that it found evidence of Gmail accounts associated with Internet Research Agency&#x26;#39;s campaign being used to open accounts on other platforms. Google did not say how many Gmail accounts were associated with these activities.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Twitter, according to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2017/10/30/4509587e-bd84-11e7-97d9-bdab5a0ab381_story.html?pushid=59f7a1634069751d0000002f&#x26;amp;tid=notifi_push_breaking-news&#x26;amp;utm_term=.c1622312d5c9&#x22;&#x3E;reports&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of its planned testimony, said it found more than 2,752 accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency, a significant increase from the approximately 200 it had initially reported. Twitter&#x26;rsquo;s initial presentation of that number drew &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/charliewarzel/twitter-russian-accounts&#x22;&#x3E;harsh criticism&#x3C;/a&#x3E; from Senate Intelligence Committee vice chair Senator Mark Warner, who called it &#x22;frankly inadequate on almost every level.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Twitter declined to comment.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;This week will be a pivotal week for all three companies as they seek to show Congress that they now have their platforms under control after the Russians exploited them during and after the 2016 election season. So far, lawmakers are proving to be a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/923603455469551616&#x22;&#x3E;difficult sell&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; and Silicon Valley&#x26;#39;s &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/facebooks-nightmare-scenario-is-unfolding-in-washington?utm_term=.hmdWvmlv0#.fwg27aA79&#x22;&#x3E;crisis in Washington&#x3C;/a&#x3E; may just be beginning.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>Facebook Just Unveiled Its Plan To Make Political Ads More Transparent</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/heres-how-facebook-will-soon-let-you-see-who-paid-for?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>Facebook plans to make political advertisers register for the program, and will track down anyone trying to avoid inclusion.</p>












 

 
	<h1>Almost a month ago, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/facebook-will-now-give-congress-the-more-than-3000-ads?utm_term=.utrYnYDJkE#.pf5BwBbl6P">promised</a> in a Facebook Live <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10104052858820231/">video</a> that the company would require a new level of transparency for political ads. This came in response to outcry over the company's disclosure that <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/facebooks-russian-ads-disclosure-opens-a-new-front-that?utm_term=.jpm9P9xzmj#.li9vnv5Wz0">Russian trolls bought more than 3,000 ads</a> on the platform.</h1>

   <p><img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-10/27/12/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-560-1509121379-3.png?resize=625:355" width="625" height="355" alt="Almost a month ago, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised in a Facebook Live video that the company would require a new level of transparency for political ads. This came in response to outcry over the company's disclosure that Russian trolls bought more than 3,000 ads on the platform." /></p>
 
	<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html">known Russian troll factory</a> spent more than $100,000 to buy the ads before and after the 2016 election. A portion of the ads were targeted by interest or geography, meaning that only the people who fit the ad parameters could see them in their News Feed.</p>

<p>After initially keeping them private, Facebook <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/facebook-will-now-give-congress-the-more-than-3000-ads?utm_term=.gkeXZXqav8#.vwQzAzJdwr">recently handed over the ads over</a> to congressional investigators. And today it announced the first details of how it plans to change the way political sponsored posts will be shown in the News Feed, and the information they will disclose.</p>


 <p><small><a rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10104052858820231/">Facebook: zuck</a></small></p>
















 

 
	<h1>Facebook also announced a new measures that will affect all non-political sponsored posts. Every page will soon have a "View Ads" option that will enable you to see the current campaigns it has running.</h1>

   <p><img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-10/27/12/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-12573-1509122072-1.png?crop=1600:1421;0,0&resize=625:*" width="625" height="555" alt="Facebook also announced a new measures that will affect all non-political sponsored posts. Every page will soon have a &quot;View Ads&quot; option that will enable you to see the current campaigns it has running." /></p>
 
	<p>This starts rolling out in Canada next month, and will eventually move to the US and other markets. This general ads page will only show current campaigns. But a Facebook executive said the company plans to build an archive for election ads.</p>

<p>"However, when we expand to the United States we plan to begin building an archive of federal-election related ads so that we can show both current and historical federal-election related ads," wrote Rob Goldman, Facebook&#39;s VP of Ads, in <a href="https://t.co/ayFOGdQwNH">a blog post</a> provided to BuzzFeed News in advance.</p>

<p>The post said that Facebook&#39;s efforts to change political sponsored posts will begin in the US for the 2018 federal election cycle. It will then be rolled out in other countries. The election ad archive will be collected into four year cycles.</p>

<p>Facebook also said it will use the Facebook View Ads page to display any ads that the same account purchases on Instagram or Messenger.</p>


 <p><small>Facebook</small></p>
















 

 
	<h1>Once rolled out, political sponsored posts will carry a "Political Ad" label under the name of the page that placed it. There will also be an "i" icon you can click to reveal more information about the entity that paid for the ad.</h1>

    <media:description type="html">The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html&#x22;&#x3E;known Russian troll factory&#x3C;/a&#x3E; spent more than $100,000 to buy the ads before and after the 2016 election. A portion of the ads were targeted by interest or geography, meaning that only the people who fit the ad parameters could see them in their News Feed.

After initially keeping them private, Facebook &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/facebook-will-now-give-congress-the-more-than-3000-ads?utm_term=.gkeXZXqav8#.vwQzAzJdwr&#x22;&#x3E;recently handed over the ads over&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to congressional investigators. And today it announced the first details of how it plans to change the way political sponsored posts will be shown in the News Feed, and the information they will disclose.</media:description>

    <media:description type="html">This starts rolling out in Canada next month, and will eventually move to the US and other markets. This general ads page will only show current campaigns. But a Facebook executive said the company plans to build an archive for election ads.

&#x22;However, when we expand to the United States we plan to begin building an archive of federal-election related ads so that we can show both current and historical federal-election related ads,&#x22; wrote Rob Goldman, Facebook&#x27;s VP of Ads, in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://t.co/ayFOGdQwNH&#x22;&#x3E;a blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; provided to BuzzFeed News in advance.

The post said that Facebook&#x27;s efforts to change political sponsored posts will begin in the US for the 2018 federal election cycle. It will then be rolled out in other countries. The election ad archive will be collected into four year cycles.

Facebook also said it will use the Facebook View Ads page to display any ads that the same account purchases on Instagram or Messenger.</media:description>
