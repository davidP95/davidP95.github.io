<p><b>The tenet that looms</b> largest in most motorcycle clubs is a fanged, unshakeable loyalty. In Skip Hollandsworth&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-gangs-all-here/">2007 story</a> about the notorious Texan motorcycle club the Bandidos, he notes, &ldquo;They defend one another. They watch each other&rsquo;s backs. That&rsquo;s part of the brotherhood.&rdquo; But that model of displaying loyalty &mdash; often through violence and a decidedly us vs. them mentality &mdash; is a world away from the ethos of the bikers who make up the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sikhmotorcycleclubofUSA/">Sikh Motorcycle Club of the Northeast</a>.</p><p>The club, which is based in New Jersey, is one of several similar groups around the <a href="http://www.bakersfield.com/news/sikh-riders-rally-to-battle-post---racial-profiling/article_b06c7ab0-9750-11e7-ae44-97bb03fd1748.html">United States</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/fighting-it-how-sikh-canadian-bikers-are-riding-religious-freedom-n615256">Canada</a>, although it&rsquo;s an independent entity. It was founded in 2012 by five men: KJ Singh, Raja Singh, Barninder Singh, Kiratbir Singh, and Daman Singh. (Traditionally, Sikh men take the last name &ldquo;Singh&rdquo; and women take the last name &ldquo;Kaur.&rdquo;)</p><p>Since the club&#39;s conception, membership has swelled from the initial five to the current roster&rsquo;s 28. The whole crew doesn&rsquo;t ride together very often: Most just come en masse to the Sikh Day Parade in New York City each spring. This year, the club has had three official rides, and there is a core group of six or seven riders who generally show up.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that the members of the Sikh Motorcycle Club aren&rsquo;t loyal to one another. But their truest devotion is to something less earthbound. The reason clubs like the Hells Angels or the Bandidos exist is largely for those who don&rsquo;t fit into society to find a path, a purpose, and a brotherhood in one another. (It&rsquo;s no coincidence that Bandidos sometimes refer to their weekly chapter gatherings as &ldquo;church meetings.&rdquo;) And for these Sikh bikers, their faith is what answers those desires.</p><p>In Sikhism there is a concept called <i>sangat</i>, meaning a fellowship of Sikh men and women who meet religiously. Barninder Singh, one of the club&rsquo;s founders, thinks of <i>sangat</i> as a way to make sense of faith and the way it is lived. &ldquo;Because you pray together, it elevates you more than praying by yourself,&rdquo; he said. This club is, for him, a <i>sangat</i>: a place where he can ask his fellow riders how best to tie a turban to ensure it fits underneath his helmet. How to keep his sons connected to a creed he does not want them to forsake.</p><p>Faith and riding are ostensibly personal affairs. But there is a reason bikers come together to ride; a reason worshippers congregate to celebrate, pray, and mourn. For Barninder, riding was never a way to make him more religious. &ldquo;At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s my journey,&rdquo; he said of his faith. &ldquo;The one thing I can say is wholly mine.&rdquo; But it helps to be around people who, through ways implicit and explicit, remind him why he has chosen the life he has.</p>

<p>Sikhism is the world&rsquo;s youngest major religion, founded in Punjab, India, 1,469 years after the birth of Christianity. It is monotheistic, and has one central religious scripture: the Guru Granth Sahib. The Sikh edict <i>dastaar binaa nahee rehnaa</i> translates to &ldquo;never be without the turban, wear it always.&rdquo; Sikhism asks its followers to leave their hair uncut as a way to respect what God has created, and so turbans serve a dual purpose: to accommodate long locks of devotion, and to turn observant Sikhs into walking symbols of their faith.<br /></p>

<p>Sikhism is the fifth largest religion in the world, but remains largely a mystery to Americans, who frequently confuse Sikhs with Muslims due to similarities between the turbans worn by Sikh men and women and the head wraps worn by some members of the Taliban.</p><p>The first victim of a deadly hate crime after 9/11 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/us/sikh-owner-of-gas-station-is-fatally-shot-in-rampage.html">was a Sikh man</a> named Balbir Singh Sodhi. The perpetrator mistook Sodhi for a Muslim, and would later justify his actions by telling police that he was a patriot. In 2012, a man entered a Sikh house of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and opened fire, killing six people and wounding three. In 2017, <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sikh-software-engineering-student-stabbed-to-death-in-us/article19608841.ece">at least three</a> Sikh men have been killed and another wounded in apparent hate crimes. Wearing a turban in the United States means living with the weight of its fabric, and recognizing that it can all too often be <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/the-hate-in-charlottesville-isnt-surprising-to-immigrants">turned into a target</a>.<br /></p>

<p>Exactly what makes someone &ldquo;American&rdquo; has been debated since the nation was a borderless, lawless dream. And we have always lived in a world where that definition has life and death consequences. But in a political landscape in which white supremacy has <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism?utm_term=.lhM7N3bkzw#.tirg9PWEq8">come back into vogue</a> and the president of the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/us/politics/trump-charlottesville-tim-scott.html?_r=0">refuses to denounce it</a>, being able to claim the label feels newly urgent.</p><p>There are many things that Sikhs have carried with them into the present from the 1400s. But chief among them is this: &ldquo;Sikhs have been a minority everywhere,&rdquo; Barninder said. &ldquo;Even in India, even in Punjab.&rdquo; Especially in the United States. Practicing Sikhs are never at risk of blending in. For the devout, their turbans &mdash; if nothing else &mdash; will always set them apart. And that is so much of the reason they wear them.</p>

	<p>Members gather to pray before the start of the Sikh Day Parade.</p>


 <p><small>Teresa Mathew for BuzzFeed News</small></p>




<p>On an overcast morning in April, rain was falling as the bikers of the club, clad in their leather vests, gathered on 37th Street to pray before the Sikh Day Parade in Midtown Manhattan. They had just finished vying for space to tie their turbans in front of the decorative mirrors of a Chinese restaurant. Now, the bikers straddled their bikes and lined up in formation on the road. Driver&rsquo;s licenses and Harley Davidsons, the latter freshly rubbed down and glossy, had been checked and cleared by the NYPD earlier that morning.</p><p>But as the members waited to take their place between two floats, an officer informed them that they would not be allowed to ride if they didn&rsquo;t wear their helmets. Although motorcycle riders are required by law to wear a helmet in New York state, for the past six years club riders have traveled in the parade at a leisurely pace (&ldquo;nearly walking the bikes,&rdquo; Barninder said) with nothing on their heads but their hair and their turbans. But this year the NYPD refused to budge.</p>

	<p>Members walk in the parade after being told they could ride with their helmets or walk without them.</p>


 <p><small>Teresa Mathew for BuzzFeed News</small></p>




<p>Some members wanted to ride without their helmets and deal with the consequences. Others suggested they just comply with the officers and put their helmets on, which would have required first unwinding and then reconfiguring their turbans.</p><p>The riders ultimately chose to park their bikes and walk down Madison Avenue, rather than remove their turbans. &ldquo;We wanted [the kids] to see us as Sikh bikers, not just bikers,&rdquo; said Barninder. He believes that motorcyclists should always wear helmets while riding; all of the bikers had ridden into the city wearing their helmets, and all would ride out the same way. But he also felt strongly that wearing helmets in the parade, and obscuring the riders&rsquo; faces and turbans, would defeat the purpose of the club&rsquo;s participation.</p><p>At the parade we had to make a choice to be Sikh or be on our bikes,&rdquo; Barninder said. &ldquo;[Being] Sikh was more important.&rdquo;</p>

 <p><small>Teresa Mathew for BuzzFeed News</small></p>




<p>When Barninder rides to the Glen Rock gurudwara, the young boys in the parking lot of that house of worship become magnetized, pulled in by the chrome of his Harley Davidson. They gather around as he drives in, clamoring to touch and sit on the bike. When he first started riding his bike there, Barninder&rsquo;s admirers looked surprised when he took off his helmet; he could tell they had expected someone clean-shaven. Most of the boys had never seen a practicing Sikh own outright this particular piece of Americana. &ldquo;Their biker cousin is someone who has shaved,&rdquo; Barninder explained, &ldquo;or their biker uncle doesn&rsquo;t have a turban anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Barninder is Indian by birth, American by choice, and Sikh by both. He came to the US when he was 18 to visit his family during summer vacation. He had no idea that by the end of the summer he would enroll at Kean University in New Jersey, abandoning his college dorm and starter motorcycle in India. Though Barninder was fluent in English, his accent plagued him as he tried to fit in.</p><p>&ldquo;When you talk like this,&rdquo; he said, affecting a thick Indian accent, &ldquo;I realized it was a barrier.&rdquo; He started watching American TV, learning to chameleon his voice. Now, his accent &mdash; the one that had put off his first-generation wife, Amrita, when they met &mdash; is gone. It has been papered over with the American vowels that come so naturally to his three young sons: Amolak, 8, Ajaivir, 5, and Japnaam, 3.</p>

<p>Barninder had been vocal on Facebook in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election, not comprehending how Trump&rsquo;s Sikh supporters could rationalize voting for a man whose vision of America seemed to have no place for them. He has no desire to ever visit the South, because, to him, the region symbolizes the racism that he and his family have more or less managed to avoid in the small-town shrubbery of New Jersey.</p><p>Barninder practices boxing and Shastar Vidiya, a Sikh martial art designed specifically for combat, with his two older sons. He owns registered handguns, and a trip to the shooting range is a normal Sunday morning activity. It is important to him that his kids feel capable and confident in their abilities to defend themselves. And he is trying to teach them what parents all over the country teach their children: to be kind, hardworking, and brave. But he watches the news. He knows how damning it can be once others deem you an outsider in America. And he wonders how to teach his children not to live their lives constrained by that fear.</p><p>So he shows them that a slice of wholehearted Americana joy can be theirs; he cuts through the Catskill Mountains on a Harley Davidson on the last day of summer, leather vest emblazoned with the colors of the Sikh Motorcycle Club, hair dutifully unshorn.</p>

	<p>The Sikh Motorcycle Club leaves the parking lot of the Nazareth gurudwara to begin their ride.</p>


 <p><small>Teresa Mathew for BuzzFeed News</small></p>




<p>The members of the Sikh Motorcycle Club love to ride, to practice what KJ Singh, another founding member, calls &ldquo;wind therapy.&rdquo; One bright morning in early June, three members met in front of a gurudwara in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. In true Indian fashion, the other half of the group trickled in slowly. As the early arrivals waited, they prayed and ate the rotis and lentil curries provided as part of the gurudwara&rsquo;s <i>langar,</i> a vegetarian meal cooked by volunteers. Once the whole crew was assembled, the riders helped one another program location details into iPhones and clambered aboard their bikes.</p><p>They rode for hours, past large swaths of rolling green fields and Shell gas stations and dappled, densely wooded back roads. As they drove their Harley Davidsons through small, sleepy suburban towns, the scene could have made for an edgy take on a Norman Rockwell painting. When they wear their helmets, clad head-to-toe in jeans and leather, the riders&rsquo; beards are the only thing that make them identifiably Sikh.</p>

<p>Harjot Singh Pannu doesn&rsquo;t twist or tuck his beard away when he rides; it flies in the headwind like gray gauze. &ldquo;I love it,&rdquo; Harjot said. &ldquo;People look at my beard and wish they have a beard like that.&rdquo; When he rides, and the wind runs through his hair, he said, &ldquo;to me, that&rsquo;s like living with nature.&rdquo;</p><p>The bikers ride together in a single line, with more experienced riders in front and at the tail end. These riders haven&rsquo;t taken the mufflers off their engines; they don&rsquo;t cut in front of cars; they don&rsquo;t claim the road. They just ride. They are happy to travel past mountains and hay bales and the occasional American flag, hung across a highway overpass or planted in green New Jersey grass.</p><p>On the road, there are no group prayers, no scriptures to follow. But there is a clear, calm, quiet focus. There is the wind and a line of unyielding gray. There is this brotherhood. It is the ordinary things that we make holy.</p>

	<p>Raja Singh, Barninder Singh, and Harjot Singh Pannu discuss the club&#39;s requirements for entry during a birthday party for a member&#39;s daughter.</p>


 <p><small>Teresa Mathew for BuzzFeed News</small></p>




<p>After the ride to Nazareth, members assembled on the lush lawn outside Manpreet Singh&rsquo;s house, a few feet away from where his daughter&rsquo;s first birthday party was in leisurely progress. With a table of curries separating them from the rest of the guests, the men sipped soda flavored with the bright tang of masala and discussed their club&rsquo;s requirements for entry. They were debating who had the right to wear the Sikh Motorcycle Club&rsquo;s vest and official logo, known in biker circles as a club&rsquo;s &ldquo;colors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Dude, you&rsquo;ve got to shape up &mdash; you drink and you trim [your beard]&#33;&rsquo;&rdquo; Raja Singh grinned as he recalled how one hopeful but errant biker had asked year after year when he could don the club&rsquo;s vest. As the club&rsquo;s roster has expanded, so, too, has the conversation over who to let in. Originally, the Sikh Motorcycle Club had gone by a different name: Khalsa. It is a name used for those who have gone through <i>amrit</i>, Sikhism&rsquo;s formal initiation ceremony. But the founders soon worried that would prove too restrictive. (<i>Amrit</i> is a commitment that has as much to do with lifestyle as it does faith; Barninder remembered one devout woman he knew who delayed the ceremony for years because she could not get used to wearing Sikh-style <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Kachera"><i>kachera</i></a> instead of Western underwear.)</p>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sikhism is the world&#x26;rsquo;s youngest major religion, founded in Punjab, India, 1,469 years after the birth of Christianity. It is monotheistic, and has one central religious scripture: the Guru Granth Sahib. The Sikh edict &#x3C;i&#x3E;dastaar binaa nahee rehnaa&#x3C;/i&#x3E; translates to &#x26;ldquo;never be without the turban, wear it always.&#x26;rdquo; Sikhism asks its followers to leave their hair uncut as a way to respect what God has created, and so turbans serve a dual purpose: to accommodate long locks of devotion, and to turn observant Sikhs into walking symbols of their faith.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sikhism is the fifth largest religion in the world, but remains largely a mystery to Americans, who frequently confuse Sikhs with Muslims due to similarities between the turbans worn by Sikh men and women and the head wraps worn by some members of the Taliban.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The first victim of a deadly hate crime after 9/11 &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/us/sikh-owner-of-gas-station-is-fatally-shot-in-rampage.html&#x22;&#x3E;was a Sikh man&#x3C;/a&#x3E; named Balbir Singh Sodhi. The perpetrator mistook Sodhi for a Muslim, and would later justify his actions by telling police that he was a patriot. In 2012, a man entered a Sikh house of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and opened fire, killing six people and wounding three. In 2017, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sikh-software-engineering-student-stabbed-to-death-in-us/article19608841.ece&#x22;&#x3E;at least three&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Sikh men have been killed and another wounded in apparent hate crimes. Wearing a turban in the United States means living with the weight of its fabric, and recognizing that it can all too often be &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/the-hate-in-charlottesville-isnt-surprising-to-immigrants&#x22;&#x3E;turned into a target&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Exactly what makes someone &#x26;ldquo;American&#x26;rdquo; has been debated since the nation was a borderless, lawless dream. And we have always lived in a world where that definition has life and death consequences. But in a political landscape in which white supremacy has &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism?utm_term=.lhM7N3bkzw#.tirg9PWEq8&#x22;&#x3E;come back into vogue&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the president of the country &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/us/politics/trump-charlottesville-tim-scott.html?_r=0&#x22;&#x3E;refuses to denounce it&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, being able to claim the label feels newly urgent.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are many things that Sikhs have carried with them into the present from the 1400s. But chief among them is this: &#x26;ldquo;Sikhs have been a minority everywhere,&#x26;rdquo; Barninder said. &#x26;ldquo;Even in India, even in Punjab.&#x26;rdquo; Especially in the United States. Practicing Sikhs are never at risk of blending in. For the devout, their turbans &#x26;mdash; if nothing else &#x26;mdash; will always set them apart. And that is so much of the reason they wear them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

	&#x3C;p&#x3E;Members gather to pray before the start of the Sikh Day Parade.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;On an overcast morning in April, rain was falling as the bikers of the club, clad in their leather vests, gathered on 37th Street to pray before the Sikh Day Parade in Midtown Manhattan. They had just finished vying for space to tie their turbans in front of the decorative mirrors of a Chinese restaurant. Now, the bikers straddled their bikes and lined up in formation on the road. Driver&#x26;rsquo;s licenses and Harley Davidsons, the latter freshly rubbed down and glossy, had been checked and cleared by the NYPD earlier that morning.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But as the members waited to take their place between two floats, an officer informed them that they would not be allowed to ride if they didn&#x26;rsquo;t wear their helmets. Although motorcycle riders are required by law to wear a helmet in New York state, for the past six years club riders have traveled in the parade at a leisurely pace (&#x26;ldquo;nearly walking the bikes,&#x26;rdquo; Barninder said) with nothing on their heads but their hair and their turbans. But this year the NYPD refused to budge.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

	&#x3C;p&#x3E;Members walk in the parade after being told they could ride with their helmets or walk without them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;


 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Teresa Mathew for BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some members wanted to ride without their helmets and deal with the consequences. Others suggested they just comply with the officers and put their helmets on, which would have required first unwinding and then reconfiguring their turbans.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The riders ultimately chose to park their bikes and walk down Madison Avenue, rather than remove their turbans. &#x26;ldquo;We wanted [the kids] to see us as Sikh bikers, not just bikers,&#x26;rdquo; said Barninder. He believes that motorcyclists should always wear helmets while riding; all of the bikers had ridden into the city wearing their helmets, and all would ride out the same way. But he also felt strongly that wearing helmets in the parade, and obscuring the riders&#x26;rsquo; faces and turbans, would defeat the purpose of the club&#x26;rsquo;s participation.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;At the parade we had to make a choice to be Sikh or be on our bikes,&#x26;rdquo; Barninder said. &#x26;ldquo;[Being] Sikh was more important.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;When Barninder rides to the Glen Rock gurudwara, the young boys in the parking lot of that house of worship become magnetized, pulled in by the chrome of his Harley Davidson. They gather around as he drives in, clamoring to touch and sit on the bike. When he first started riding his bike there, Barninder&#x26;rsquo;s admirers looked surprised when he took off his helmet; he could tell they had expected someone clean-shaven. Most of the boys had never seen a practicing Sikh own outright this particular piece of Americana. &#x26;ldquo;Their biker cousin is someone who has shaved,&#x26;rdquo; Barninder explained, &#x26;ldquo;or their biker uncle doesn&#x26;rsquo;t have a turban anymore.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Barninder is Indian by birth, American by choice, and Sikh by both. He came to the US when he was 18 to visit his family during summer vacation. He had no idea that by the end of the summer he would enroll at Kean University in New Jersey, abandoning his college dorm and starter motorcycle in India. Though Barninder was fluent in English, his accent plagued him as he tried to fit in.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;When you talk like this,&#x26;rdquo; he said, affecting a thick Indian accent, &#x26;ldquo;I realized it was a barrier.&#x26;rdquo; He started watching American TV, learning to chameleon his voice. Now, his accent &#x26;mdash; the one that had put off his first-generation wife, Amrita, when they met &#x26;mdash; is gone. It has been papered over with the American vowels that come so naturally to his three young sons: Amolak, 8, Ajaivir, 5, and Japnaam, 3.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Barninder had been vocal on Facebook in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election, not comprehending how Trump&#x26;rsquo;s Sikh supporters could rationalize voting for a man whose vision of America seemed to have no place for them. He has no desire to ever visit the South, because, to him, the region symbolizes the racism that he and his family have more or less managed to avoid in the small-town shrubbery of New Jersey.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Barninder practices boxing and Shastar Vidiya, a Sikh martial art designed specifically for combat, with his two older sons. He owns registered handguns, and a trip to the shooting range is a normal Sunday morning activity. It is important to him that his kids feel capable and confident in their abilities to defend themselves. And he is trying to teach them what parents all over the country teach their children: to be kind, hardworking, and brave. But he watches the news. He knows how damning it can be once others deem you an outsider in America. And he wonders how to teach his children not to live their lives constrained by that fear.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;So he shows them that a slice of wholehearted Americana joy can be theirs; he cuts through the Catskill Mountains on a Harley Davidson on the last day of summer, leather vest emblazoned with the colors of the Sikh Motorcycle Club, hair dutifully unshorn.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;The members of the Sikh Motorcycle Club love to ride, to practice what KJ Singh, another founding member, calls &#x26;ldquo;wind therapy.&#x26;rdquo; One bright morning in early June, three members met in front of a gurudwara in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. In true Indian fashion, the other half of the group trickled in slowly. As the early arrivals waited, they prayed and ate the rotis and lentil curries provided as part of the gurudwara&#x26;rsquo;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;langar,&#x3C;/i&#x3E; a vegetarian meal cooked by volunteers. Once the whole crew was assembled, the riders helped one another program location details into iPhones and clambered aboard their bikes.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;They rode for hours, past large swaths of rolling green fields and Shell gas stations and dappled, densely wooded back roads. As they drove their Harley Davidsons through small, sleepy suburban towns, the scene could have made for an edgy take on a Norman Rockwell painting. When they wear their helmets, clad head-to-toe in jeans and leather, the riders&#x26;rsquo; beards are the only thing that make them identifiably Sikh.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Harjot Singh Pannu doesn&#x26;rsquo;t twist or tuck his beard away when he rides; it flies in the headwind like gray gauze. &#x26;ldquo;I love it,&#x26;rdquo; Harjot said. &#x26;ldquo;People look at my beard and wish they have a beard like that.&#x26;rdquo; When he rides, and the wind runs through his hair, he said, &#x26;ldquo;to me, that&#x26;rsquo;s like living with nature.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The bikers ride together in a single line, with more experienced riders in front and at the tail end. These riders haven&#x26;rsquo;t taken the mufflers off their engines; they don&#x26;rsquo;t cut in front of cars; they don&#x26;rsquo;t claim the road. They just ride. They are happy to travel past mountains and hay bales and the occasional American flag, hung across a highway overpass or planted in green New Jersey grass.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the road, there are no group prayers, no scriptures to follow. But there is a clear, calm, quiet focus. There is the wind and a line of unyielding gray. There is this brotherhood. It is the ordinary things that we make holy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Teresa Mathew for BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;After the ride to Nazareth, members assembled on the lush lawn outside Manpreet Singh&#x26;rsquo;s house, a few feet away from where his daughter&#x26;rsquo;s first birthday party was in leisurely progress. With a table of curries separating them from the rest of the guests, the men sipped soda flavored with the bright tang of masala and discussed their club&#x26;rsquo;s requirements for entry. They were debating who had the right to wear the Sikh Motorcycle Club&#x26;rsquo;s vest and official logo, known in biker circles as a club&#x26;rsquo;s &#x26;ldquo;colors.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I said, &#x26;lsquo;Dude, you&#x26;rsquo;ve got to shape up &#x26;mdash; you drink and you trim [your beard]&#x26;#33;&#x26;rsquo;&#x26;rdquo; Raja Singh grinned as he recalled how one hopeful but errant biker had asked year after year when he could don the club&#x26;rsquo;s vest. As the club&#x26;rsquo;s roster has expanded, so, too, has the conversation over who to let in. Originally, the Sikh Motorcycle Club had gone by a different name: Khalsa. It is a name used for those who have gone through &#x3C;i&#x3E;amrit&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, Sikhism&#x26;rsquo;s formal initiation ceremony. But the founders soon worried that would prove too restrictive. (&#x3C;i&#x3E;Amrit&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is a commitment that has as much to do with lifestyle as it does faith; Barninder remembered one devout woman he knew who delayed the ceremony for years because she could not get used to wearing Sikh-style &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Kachera&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;kachera&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; instead of Western underwear.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

	<p>Kevin Spacey</p>


 <p><small>Slaven Vlasic / FilmMagic</small></p>




<p><i>On Oct. 29, BuzzFeed News</i> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/anthony-rapp-kevin-spacey-made-sexual-advance-when-i-was-14"><i>published a story</i></a> <i>about actor Anthony Rapp, who alleged that</i> House of Cards <i>actor Kevin Spacey made a sexual advance toward him when he was 14, in 1986. Since that story, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/susancheng/men-who-kevin-spacey-has-allegedly-sexually-harassed?utm_term=.lbmXD0lzq#.ti3j8JMpG">many more</a> men have <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/kevin-spacey-more-accusations-secrets-abuse?utm_term=.uqOM1Y0Q3#.aygB8RY7A">come forward</a> with allegations against Spacey, ranging from workplace harassment to attempted rape. In this account, actor Harry Dreyfuss, son of Oscar-winning actor Richard Dreyfuss, details in his own words his own experience with Spacey. BuzzFeed News verified with five people &mdash; including his father, and his brother Ben &mdash; that Dreyfuss shared this story with them, and his father confirmed he was present for the night in question. On Wednesday, Spacey&rsquo;s publicist released a</i> <a href="https://twitter.com/adambvary/status/925940738185035776"><i>statement</i></a> <i>that Spacey is seeking unspecified &ldquo;evaluation and treatment.&rdquo; When asked to comment on Dreyfuss&rsquo;s story, Bryan Freedman, a lawyer representing Spacey, said, &ldquo;</i><i>Let me be clear, Mr. Spacey absolutely denies the allegations.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>When I was</b> an 18-year-old senior in high school, Kevin Spacey groped me.</p><p>It was 2008, and he was directing my father, Richard Dreyfuss, in a play called <a href="https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2009/complicit"><i>Complicit</i></a> at the Old Vic in London. I&rsquo;d come to visit for Christmas Break. It happened one night when the three of us were alone in Kevin&rsquo;s apartment rehearsing my father&rsquo;s lines. My father didn&rsquo;t see, and I didn&rsquo;t tell him about the incident for many years. Instead, I spent the next nine years telling people the story at parties for laughs.</p><p>I lived by Carrie Fisher&rsquo;s brilliant line, &ldquo;If my life wasn&rsquo;t funny, it would just be true, and that is unacceptable.&rdquo; Telling the story as a joke ensured that this was a story I could <i>own.</i> If I could laugh at it, then surely I was not a victim. As a young storyteller from a family dedicated to seeing the funny side of the absurd, this was my way of defanging the whole thing.</p><p>That technique fell apart once I got to college and started telling the story to people in the theater world in New York. Often, they would respond by saying, &ldquo;I know a guy that that happened to as well.&rdquo; The victims in many of these stories were often young men. These admissions became so common that I started to plan on a break in the story just so people could nod and say, &ldquo;Oh yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard this before.&rdquo; All of these responses made me realize there wasn&rsquo;t anything funny about my story. It wasn&rsquo;t a joke. As I write this, 10 people, including <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/anthony-rapp-kevin-spacey-made-sexual-advance-when-i-was-14?utm_term=.kdwW5nyaE#.cmdWXqQGe">actor Anthony Rapp</a>, have <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/kevin-spacey-alleged-sexual-relationship.html?utm_campaign=vulture&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=s1">come forward</a> with their <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41828874">own allegations</a>, which <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/02/media/house-of-cards-kevin-spacey-harassment/index.html">points</a> to a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41829484">pattern</a> &mdash; Kevin Spacey is a sexual predator. But I still never thought talking about it seriously was ever an option.</p><p>First of all, on the scale of sexual abuse, I felt that what happened to me was relatively minor. It wasn&rsquo;t until this year, when so many people have bravely come out with their stories, and the demand for a better world has gotten such broad support, that I saw my own story has value. What I see now is that when it comes to sexual abuse, there is no such thing as a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; assault. And if telling this story will help others speak up, then it is worth it. I also can&rsquo;t stand that Kevin, in <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/924848412842971136">his apology</a>, tried to distract from the real problem here by coming out, and in so doing managed to undermine all the work the LGBT community has done to do away with the association between pedophilia and homosexuality. The fact that he&rsquo;s gay is not what&rsquo;s important. Rather, it&rsquo;s that he has no respect for consent. A lot of people have warned me this could hurt my career because it will make me look like I&rsquo;m &ldquo;jumping on the bandwagon.&rdquo; But as long as the bandwagon is outing a sexual predator&hellip;then I&rsquo;m good with that.</p>

<p><b>The Details</b></p><p>I remember before it happened I was so excited to meet Kevin. But I was also terrified that he would be just like so many of the characters he plays &mdash; a cold, calculating prick. But the first time I met him, he put all my worries to rest. He saw me and his eyes lit up. He gave me such a warm smile, and instead of shaking my hand, he gave me a hug. Instantly, my young-man-perpetually-seeking-father-figures heart melted. All I remember thinking was <i>you&rsquo;re so nice.</i></p><p>Then the cast of the play started their first run-through. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t understand that the stage was taped out on the floor in a circle (the play was to be in the round), and the chair I was sitting on was inside the tape. I was onstage. Five minutes into the read, someone pointed that out, and I was morbidly embarrassed. Kevin came up to me, and I, sweating and blushing, apologized and started to get out of my seat. Kevin told me to keep sitting, and kindly, so kindly, came up behind my chair and grabbed the back of the seat. He proceeded to lift the chair into the air with me in it, and carry it out of the rehearsal space. Again, I thought <i>you&rsquo;re so nice.</i></p><p>A few days later my father had an appointment to meet Kevin at his apartment to run lines. I came along, excited to get to spend some time with my newest and most famous male authority figure.</p>











 <p>He wrapped his fingers between my fingers, and peered into my eyes, and warmly said, "Don&#39;t be shy."</p>






<p>We were in Kevin&rsquo;s kitchen when my dad ducked out for a moment to go to the bathroom. Kevin and I were looking out his window at the lights of London, when he came to my side and asked me how my Christmas had been. I had had a terrible Christmas, I told him, because I was too shy. I was 18, I&rsquo;d mustered the courage to leave our hotel and go get legally drunk for the first time in my life, but I didn&rsquo;t have the nerve to speak with anyone. Instead, I had a few drinks and then promptly returned to my hotel room to watch <i>Tropic Thunder</i> for the fourth time. After I&rsquo;d told him that, Kevin slid his hand into mine. He wrapped his fingers between my fingers, and peered into my eyes, and warmly said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be shy.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get over it.&rdquo; I was stunned.</p><p><i>You&rsquo;re so nice.</i></p><p>Finally the three of us moved into his living room to read the script. My dad sat in a big chair on the side of the room, while Kevin and I sat on his couch. Kevin was sitting extremely close to me, but I didn&rsquo;t blink because Kevin handed me the script and told me to read with my dad (playing the part of his wife). The only thing going through my mind at the time was how amazing it was that I was getting to act in front of one of my idols.</p><p>After a few minutes, he put his hand on my thigh. Finally (finally, finally) I became suspicious. It took that long because it just never occurred to me that Kevin would be interested in me in the first place. He was an adult man, a hero of mine, my dad&rsquo;s boss, none of which were categories on my radar for sexual interactions. Besides, I thought, <i>Surely he can&rsquo;t be coming on to me like this right in front of my dad.</i> But his hand stayed there. So after a bit, I came up with what I thought was a brilliant safety tactic: I stood up and walked to the other side of the couch, and sat back down. Bulletproof. But without missing a beat, Kevin stood up too, and followed me. He sat just as close and immediately put his hand back on my thigh.</p><p>My dad saw none of this and none of what would follow, because he was deeply focused on his script. (Richard Dreyfuss confirmed to BuzzFeed News that he did not see the incident at the time and was not made aware of it until Harry told him several years later.)</p><p>I was unable to process what was happening: My dad and I were pretending to be lovers in a play while Kevin Spacey was trying to seduce me and all the while in real life I was a hapless, straight virgin who just wanted to become a famous actor.</p><p>So I stood up one more time and returned to my original place on the couch, giving Kevin another opportunity to take the hint. I also added one more layer of protection. The moment I sat down, I firmly placed my own hands upon my thighs, palms down, claiming that territory for myself.</p>

<p>Once again Kevin followed me, sat down, and with considerable effort, slid his hand between my right hand and my right leg. He&rsquo;d snuck in. At this point I didn&rsquo;t think there was anything I could do short of alerting my dad to what was happening. But I didn&rsquo;t want to start a feud between them. I didn&rsquo;t want the play to be threatened. This job really mattered to my dad, and Kevin was his boss. And besides, I thought, <i>He isn&rsquo;t really doing anything wrong</i>...</p><p>And then he did. Over the course of about 20 seconds, centimeter by centimeter, Kevin crawled his hand from my thigh over toward my crotch. My mind went blank. Suddenly, he had completed his journey and now he had all of me in his hand. I stopped reading the script and my eyes went wide. I lifted up my head and faced him. Looking into his eyes, I gave the most meager shake of my head that I could manage. I was trying to warn him without alerting my dad, who still had his eyes glued to the page. I thought I was protecting everyone. I was protecting my dad&rsquo;s career. I was protecting Kevin, who my dad surely would have tried to punch. I was protecting myself, because I thought one day I&rsquo;d want to work with this man. Kevin had no reaction and kept his hand there. My eyes went back to the script and I kept reading.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how long we sat there like that. It could have been as little as 20 seconds, or it could have been five minutes. It&rsquo;s the hardest part of the story for me to recall. What I do remember is that, other than being a shy kid who obviously admired Kevin Spacey a lot, I never once gave him a signal that I would want to be with him in that way.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t remember how the night ended. I don&rsquo;t remember leaving. I&rsquo;m sure it looked entirely normal. We probably hugged and smiled as we left. I didn&rsquo;t tell my dad anything then. I went home to my hotel and probably watched <i>Tropic Thunder</i> again. But I obviously couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.</p><p><b>Speaking Up</b></p><p>Now having had nine years to process it, it finally is clear to me how wrong Kevin&rsquo;s behavior was. Not because of how it made me feel. Again, I think being male, and roughly the same size as Kevin, meant that I never felt physically unsafe. My dad was in the room, and I could have alerted him at any time. It didn&rsquo;t make me feel traumatized, and instead I spun it into a funny story. Kevin Spacey came on to me&#33; He&rsquo;s famous&#33; Haha&#33;</p><p>And that kind of thinking has to be addressed. I did a lot of mental gymnastics to normalize my experience. For the last nine years, whenever I would tell this story to people who refused to laugh &mdash; who insisted that I had gone through something profoundly wrong &mdash; I would always try to downplay it so they could just see the funny side. I especially wanted to discourage them from thinking that what happened to me was something I ever needed to speak publicly about. This is how I approached finally telling my father when I was in college, four or five years after the incident. He was furious, and I spent the rest of the evening ensuring him that it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal, and that I would be mortified if he did anything about it.</p><p>As the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/harvey-weinstein-sexual-misconduct-allegations?utm_term=.hfkRl93bN#.nu3bADg7Z">allegations against</a> Harvey Weinstein came rolling in, and so many women I know posted their stories of sexual abuse during the #MeToo campaign, I came to see how important it is to add my voice to the people who are demanding a better world. A world in which powerful men are no longer allowed to feel safe to do this, or far worse. In retrospect, what disgusts me about Kevin was how safe he did feel. He knew he could fondle me in a room with my father and that I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word. He knew I wouldn&rsquo;t have had the guts. And I didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>So to all the people who have spoken up already, about Kevin, about <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/harvey-weinstein-sexual-misconduct-allegations?utm_term=.ty2RLPpMO#.ygNmy412o">Harvey Weinstein</a>, and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/here-are-all-the-women-who-have-accused-bill-cosby-of-sexual?utm_term=.us6v0471A#.haQk69BlN">Bill Cosby</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html">Bill O&rsquo;Reilly</a>, and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/more-women-have-accused-fox-news-ceo-roger-ailes-of-sexual-h?utm_term=.mdQZeJdn0#.aunpZANxr">Roger Ailes</a>, and all the women who have opened my eyes to how pervasive this problem is, I can&rsquo;t thank you enough. You helped me see that what was once treated as normal never deserved to be, and that things we all could have condemned sooner were happening right under many of our noses. In minimizing my own experience all these years, I unwittingly played a role in minimizing it for everyone. That ends now. This was never a funny story. Rather than a punchline, I hope my story can serve as inspiration to others who may have felt that they couldn&rsquo;t or shouldn&rsquo;t speak up until now.</p>

A lot of people have warned me this could hurt my career because it will make me look like I&#x26;rsquo;m &#x26;ldquo;jumping on the bandwagon.&#x26;rdquo; But as long as the bandwagon is outing a sexual predator&#x26;hellip;then I&#x26;rsquo;m good with that.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;The Details&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I remember before it happened I was so excited to meet Kevin. But I was also terrified that he would be just like so many of the characters he plays &#x26;mdash; a cold, calculating prick. But the first time I met him, he put all my worries to rest. He saw me and his eyes lit up. He gave me such a warm smile, and instead of shaking my hand, he gave me a hug. Instantly, my young-man-perpetually-seeking-father-figures heart melted. All I remember thinking was &#x3C;i&#x3E;you&#x26;rsquo;re so nice.&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Then the cast of the play started their first run-through. At the time, I didn&#x26;rsquo;t understand that the stage was taped out on the floor in a circle (the play was to be in the round), and the chair I was sitting on was inside the tape. I was onstage. Five minutes into the read, someone pointed that out, and I was morbidly embarrassed. Kevin came up to me, and I, sweating and blushing, apologized and started to get out of my seat. Kevin told me to keep sitting, and kindly, so kindly, came up behind my chair and grabbed the back of the seat. He proceeded to lift the chair into the air with me in it, and carry it out of the rehearsal space. Again, I thought &#x3C;i&#x3E;you&#x26;rsquo;re so nice.&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;A few days later my father had an appointment to meet Kevin at his apartment to run lines. I came along, excited to get to spend some time with my newest and most famous male authority figure.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;He wrapped his fingers between my fingers, and peered into my eyes, and warmly said, &#x22;Don&#x26;#39;t be shy.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;We were in Kevin&#x26;rsquo;s kitchen when my dad ducked out for a moment to go to the bathroom. Kevin and I were looking out his window at the lights of London, when he came to my side and asked me how my Christmas had been. I had had a terrible Christmas, I told him, because I was too shy. I was 18, I&#x26;rsquo;d mustered the courage to leave our hotel and go get legally drunk for the first time in my life, but I didn&#x26;rsquo;t have the nerve to speak with anyone. Instead, I had a few drinks and then promptly returned to my hotel room to watch &#x3C;i&#x3E;Tropic Thunder&#x3C;/i&#x3E; for the fourth time. After I&#x26;rsquo;d told him that, Kevin slid his hand into mine. He wrapped his fingers between my fingers, and peered into my eyes, and warmly said, &#x26;ldquo;Don&#x26;rsquo;t be shy.&#x26;rdquo; Then, &#x26;ldquo;You&#x26;rsquo;ll get over it.&#x26;rdquo; I was stunned.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;You&#x26;rsquo;re so nice.&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally the three of us moved into his living room to read the script. My dad sat in a big chair on the side of the room, while Kevin and I sat on his couch. Kevin was sitting extremely close to me, but I didn&#x26;rsquo;t blink because Kevin handed me the script and told me to read with my dad (playing the part of his wife). The only thing going through my mind at the time was how amazing it was that I was getting to act in front of one of my idols.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;After a few minutes, he put his hand on my thigh. Finally (finally, finally) I became suspicious. It took that long because it just never occurred to me that Kevin would be interested in me in the first place. He was an adult man, a hero of mine, my dad&#x26;rsquo;s boss, none of which were categories on my radar for sexual interactions. Besides, I thought, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Surely he can&#x26;rsquo;t be coming on to me like this right in front of my dad.&#x3C;/i&#x3E; But his hand stayed there. So after a bit, I came up with what I thought was a brilliant safety tactic: I stood up and walked to the other side of the couch, and sat back down. Bulletproof. But without missing a beat, Kevin stood up too, and followed me. He sat just as close and immediately put his hand back on my thigh.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;My dad saw none of this and none of what would follow, because he was deeply focused on his script. (Richard Dreyfuss confirmed to BuzzFeed News that he did not see the incident at the time and was not made aware of it until Harry told him several years later.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I was unable to process what was happening: My dad and I were pretending to be lovers in a play while Kevin Spacey was trying to seduce me and all the while in real life I was a hapless, straight virgin who just wanted to become a famous actor.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;So I stood up one more time and returned to my original place on the couch, giving Kevin another opportunity to take the hint. I also added one more layer of protection. The moment I sat down, I firmly placed my own hands upon my thighs, palms down, claiming that territory for myself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

	&#x3C;p&#x3E;Richard Dreyfuss and Kevin Spacey promoting &#x3C;i&#x3E;Complicit&#x3C;/i&#x3E; in a video interview.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;


 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;YouTube / Via &#x3C;a rel=&#x22;nofollow&#x22;  target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;  href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7KSVfAv1OI&#x22;&#x3E;youtube.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;Once again Kevin followed me, sat down, and with considerable effort, slid his hand between my right hand and my right leg. He&#x26;rsquo;d snuck in. At this point I didn&#x26;rsquo;t think there was anything I could do short of alerting my dad to what was happening. But I didn&#x26;rsquo;t want to start a feud between them. I didn&#x26;rsquo;t want the play to be threatened. This job really mattered to my dad, and Kevin was his boss. And besides, I thought, &#x3C;i&#x3E;He isn&#x26;rsquo;t really doing anything wrong&#x3C;/i&#x3E;...&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;And then he did. Over the course of about 20 seconds, centimeter by centimeter, Kevin crawled his hand from my thigh over toward my crotch. My mind went blank. Suddenly, he had completed his journey and now he had all of me in his hand. I stopped reading the script and my eyes went wide. I lifted up my head and faced him. Looking into his eyes, I gave the most meager shake of my head that I could manage. I was trying to warn him without alerting my dad, who still had his eyes glued to the page. I thought I was protecting everyone. I was protecting my dad&#x26;rsquo;s career. I was protecting Kevin, who my dad surely would have tried to punch. I was protecting myself, because I thought one day I&#x26;rsquo;d want to work with this man. Kevin had no reaction and kept his hand there. My eyes went back to the script and I kept reading.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I don&#x26;#39;t know how long we sat there like that. It could have been as little as 20 seconds, or it could have been five minutes. It&#x26;rsquo;s the hardest part of the story for me to recall. What I do remember is that, other than being a shy kid who obviously admired Kevin Spacey a lot, I never once gave him a signal that I would want to be with him in that way.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I can&#x26;rsquo;t remember how the night ended. I don&#x26;rsquo;t remember leaving. I&#x26;rsquo;m sure it looked entirely normal. We probably hugged and smiled as we left. I didn&#x26;rsquo;t tell my dad anything then. I went home to my hotel and probably watched &#x3C;i&#x3E;Tropic Thunder&#x3C;/i&#x3E; again. But I obviously couldn&#x26;rsquo;t stop thinking about it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Speaking Up&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Now having had nine years to process it, it finally is clear to me how wrong Kevin&#x26;rsquo;s behavior was. Not because of how it made me feel. Again, I think being male, and roughly the same size as Kevin, meant that I never felt physically unsafe. My dad was in the room, and I could have alerted him at any time. It didn&#x26;rsquo;t make me feel traumatized, and instead I spun it into a funny story. Kevin Spacey came on to me&#x26;#33; He&#x26;rsquo;s famous&#x26;#33; Haha&#x26;#33;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;And that kind of thinking has to be addressed. I did a lot of mental gymnastics to normalize my experience. For the last nine years, whenever I would tell this story to people who refused to laugh &#x26;mdash; who insisted that I had gone through something profoundly wrong &#x26;mdash; I would always try to downplay it so they could just see the funny side. I especially wanted to discourage them from thinking that what happened to me was something I ever needed to speak publicly about. This is how I approached finally telling my father when I was in college, four or five years after the incident. He was furious, and I spent the rest of the evening ensuring him that it wasn&#x26;rsquo;t a big deal, and that I would be mortified if he did anything about it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;As the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/harvey-weinstein-sexual-misconduct-allegations?utm_term=.hfkRl93bN#.nu3bADg7Z&#x22;&#x3E;allegations against&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Harvey Weinstein came rolling in, and so many women I know posted their stories of sexual abuse during the #MeToo campaign, I came to see how important it is to add my voice to the people who are demanding a better world. A world in which powerful men are no longer allowed to feel safe to do this, or far worse. In retrospect, what disgusts me about Kevin was how safe he did feel. He knew he could fondle me in a room with my father and that I wouldn&#x26;rsquo;t say a word. He knew I wouldn&#x26;rsquo;t have had the guts. And I didn&#x26;rsquo;t.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;So to all the people who have spoken up already, about Kevin, about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/harvey-weinstein-sexual-misconduct-allegations?utm_term=.ty2RLPpMO#.ygNmy412o&#x22;&#x3E;Harvey Weinstein&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/here-are-all-the-women-who-have-accused-bill-cosby-of-sexual?utm_term=.us6v0471A#.haQk69BlN&#x22;&#x3E;Bill Cosby&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html&#x22;&#x3E;Bill O&#x26;rsquo;Reilly&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/more-women-have-accused-fox-news-ceo-roger-ailes-of-sexual-h?utm_term=.mdQZeJdn0#.aunpZANxr&#x22;&#x3E;Roger Ailes&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and all the women who have opened my eyes to how pervasive this problem is, I can&#x26;rsquo;t thank you enough. You helped me see that what was once treated as normal never deserved to be, and that things we all could have condemned sooner were happening right under many of our noses. In minimizing my own experience all these years, I unwittingly played a role in minimizing it for everyone. That ends now. This was never a funny story. Rather than a punchline, I hope my story can serve as inspiration to others who may have felt that they couldn&#x26;rsquo;t or shouldn&#x26;rsquo;t speak up until now.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

	<p>Sarah Gadon as Grace Marks in <i>Alias Grace</i>.</p>


 <p><small>Jan Thijs/Netflix</small></p>




<p><i>Alias Grace</i>, Netflix&rsquo;s new six-episode adaptation of the novel by Margaret Atwood, opens in a way that&rsquo;ll make you think you&rsquo;re watching <i>Masterpiece Theater</i>: credits running over images of household objects and faded drawings, paired with a mournful violin score. But as with so much of Atwood&rsquo;s work, the setting is a subterfuge, one of many ways that Atwood cloaks the central themes of her work: namely, the various emotionally and psychologically violent ways that women react to living under patriarchy.<br /></p><p>Atwood&rsquo;s novel is a piece of historical fiction, rooted in the story of &ldquo;famous murderess&rdquo; Grace Marks, who, along with fellow servant James McDermott, was convicted in 1843 of murdering Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. Marks was sentenced to life, while McDermott was hanged. Atwood&rsquo;s novel and the miniseries tell the story of the crime, but frame it as more than a murder mystery &mdash; it&rsquo;s also an exploration of how women cope with years of accumulated and sublimated rage.</p><p>In <i>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</i>, Hulu&rsquo;s recent Emmy-winning adaptation of another Atwood novel, patriarchy is stretched to a dystopian dimension, with fertile women made to serve as childbearing chattel for those in power. The women affected by this scenario process their rage in various ways: The handmaids are assembled and compelled to beat men accused of sex crimes, while the complicit wives vent the horror of their situations by physically and emotionally abusing the handmaids, the only people over whom they wield power.</p><p>In <i>Alias Grace</i>, the setting is less explicitly dystopian, ostensibly clothed in soothing tones of a historical drama where servants are pleasant and well-spoken, masters are benign, and the world is good. But the world was not good at all for an Irish immigrant servant in the 19th century, and <i>Alias Grace</i> is one of the select onscreen depictions of the Victorian era that acknowledges as much.</p><p>Such portrayals usually employ a sort of filmic &ldquo;social realism,&rdquo; dramatizing poverty and inequality in a way that keeps it at a safe distance from the viewer. Don&rsquo;t worry, these texts suggest: Things sucked then, but think of how much less they suck now. But <i>Alias Grace</i>, and the insidious effects of patriarchy that it portrays, feels inextricable from our present.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not just that Grace &mdash; as an immigrant, and a servant, and a woman &mdash; lacks power. It&rsquo;s that those who do have power in her world exploit the imbalance in horrific ways, to the extent that she&rsquo;s driven to her own act of horror in order to end it. That act isn&rsquo;t portrayed as vicarious wish fulfillment, or cathartic in any way. Instead, it&rsquo;s a testament to what women are taught to tolerate &mdash; both in Grace&rsquo;s time and today &mdash; until they break under the burden.</p>

	<p>Sarah Gadon as Grace Marks.</p>


 <p><small>Sabrina Lantos/Netflix</small></p>




<p>Grace&rsquo;s childhood, which she narrates in measured, careful tones, was marked by quotidian tragedy and suffering: She was one of eight children; she watched her mother die at sea as they crossed from Ireland to Canada. Her drunken father abuses her, calls her a whore, and forces her to leave the family to go to work &mdash; commanding her to return her wages for him to drink away. She finds work as a maid, in households where the sons and fathers treat female servants as sexual playthings; &ldquo;there are some masters who think you owe them service 24 hours a day, and that you should do the main work flat on your back,&rdquo; she tells the doctor. Like other women of her age and station, Grace lives in terror that an unwanted pregnancy, the result of such unwanted but unrefusable advances, will lead to her ruin &mdash; which is precisely what happens to her best and only friend, who dies after a back alley abortion.<br /></p><p>Atwood first wrote about Grace Marks &mdash; who became a vivid fixture in the Canadian imaginary over the course of her trial &mdash; in <i>The Journals of Susanna</i>, a poetry collection published in 1970. But the character stayed with her. In 1997, Atwood returned to Grace Marks with <i>Alias Grace</i>, approaching her story through the plot device of a fictional doctor, newly enlightened by the nascent principles of psychology, attempting to determine whether or not Grace had indeed committed the murders or was subject to momentary insanity.</p><p>The book mixes Grace&rsquo;s conversations with the doctor with her internal meditation on their interactions and her recollections of the past. The miniseries, which was adapted by filmmaker Sarah Polley, skillfully interweaves the three temporalities, underlining how women are taught to tell the stories of themselves and their trauma in ways that both titillate and exonerate the listener.</p><p>Those two elements are the foundation of the &ldquo;true crime&rdquo; genre, whose most gripping stories are those in which people enact the unspeakable and scandalous. That means sex crimes, of course, but also crimes that demonstrate dominion &mdash; men who annihilate women; women who fight back against men. The &ldquo;facts&rdquo; of a crime are embroidered with excuses, motives, and speculation that say more about the audience and their needs than those of the perpetrators or victims. &ldquo;Real life&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;true crime&rdquo; when it is turned into a narrative with a logical motivation, rising climax, graphic event, righteous capture, and justice served.</p><p>Yet Polley &mdash; who worked closely with Atwood in her adaptation, along with director Mary Harron &mdash; refuses to follow those usual tenets. <i>Alias Grace</i> becomes a meditation on the way true crime narratives are formed, but it also explodes the existing narrative around Grace herself. Without giving away any spoilers, it&rsquo;s clear that Grace has sublimated the rage of living under patriarchy, but it&rsquo;s unclear how, exactly, that manifested &mdash; and whether psychology is even equipped to understand the complex processes that occur over the course of decades of repressed trauma.</p><p>Unlike most true crime narratives, <i>Alias Grace</i> promises and proffers little in the way of concrete answers. Instead, it poses a series of open questions: How does constant surveillance condition behavior? How do &ldquo;good&rdquo; men become party to the actions of the bad ones? How do women internalize the idea that other women &mdash; especially those in power &mdash; will never truly be their allies? <i>What is survivable?</i></p>

<p>These questions hover around Grace&rsquo;s story, but they&rsquo;re no less pertinent today. Atwood has never been cagey about the fact that her &ldquo;historical&rdquo; and dystopian novels are simply refractions of current issues, especially those facing women. And while it&rsquo;s happenstance that <i>Alias Grace</i> will (re)enter public consciousness amid an avalanche of allegations against men who have exploited their power to abuse, harass, or otherwise violate women, those allegations and <i>Alias Grace</i> are simply two different vantages of the same reality &mdash; in which patriarchy is never not in the process of finding ways to sustain itself.</p><p>That word &mdash; <i>patriarchy &mdash;</i> has become both overfreighted and evacuated of meaning; it&rsquo;s become the sort of SJW rhetoric that makes bros shut down and stop listening. But patriarchy isn&rsquo;t a feminist buzzword. It simply describes the organizing social principle of our world, in which men have held and continue to control the levers of power. Men largely decide what is legal and what is ethical. Men lead the vast majority of businesses and occupy the majority of offices in local, state, and federal government. Men make considerably more money. Which isn&rsquo;t to suggest that women lack power altogether; rather, it&rsquo;s to emphasize that the majority of power is still held by men, and as a result, women find themselves in the position of constantly negotiating that power.</p><p>Of course, not all men abuse their power, and some men are abused. But as both <i>Alias Grace</i> and the specifics of recent stories from accusers make clear, men and women alike become ready (if sometimes unconscious) accessories to interactions, relationships, and ideologies that keep patriarchy in place. Harvey Weinstein&rsquo;s assistants, for example, helped set <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories">&ldquo;honey pots&rdquo;</a> for the women he wished to prey upon; Grace&rsquo;s mistresses, terrified of losing their own limited place of power, spite and degrade her.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what power does, as Lainey Gossip <a href="http://www.laineygossip.com/harvey-weinstein-s-bullsh-t-apology-and-victim-attacks-after-NYT-sexual-harassment-allegations/48107">wrote</a> in regard to her own role in keeping the rumors about Weinstein under wraps: &ldquo;It corrupts both the people who have it and the people who are subject to it. For those who have it, it becomes a weapon against the weak. And for the weak, it limits their freedom, it compels them to compromise, and in compromising, they become an accessory to that gun, the silencer that&rsquo;s attached to it.&rdquo; The women involved aren&rsquo;t innocent. But it&rsquo;s patriarchy and its privileges &mdash; not the women themselves &mdash; who are the root of the problem.</p><p>That&rsquo;s an idea that <i>Mindhunter</i> &mdash; another Netflix show about the true crime stories we tell ourselves &mdash; explores, however obliquely, in its first episode. The main character, a young FBI agent in the 1970s, grapples with a new &ldquo;type&rdquo; of crime that resists old classifications and understandings. His grad student girlfriend asks if he&rsquo;s ever heard of the work of (now canonical) sociologist &Eacute;mile Durkheim, who, as she puts it, was &ldquo;one of the first to suggest that criminality is a response when something&rsquo;s wrong with society.&rdquo;</p><p>Put differently, <i>crime</i> &mdash; or transgression against social norms &mdash; occurs when those social norms are incorrect, under threat, or no longer make sense. Within this paradigm, Grace&rsquo;s violence might be immoral, but it is a logical response to patriarchy, and the only resistance of which she was capable. That idea is revealed gradually, but it is not treated as revelation. It is not a question answered; it is a given.</p><p>The question that <i>Alias Grace</i> <i>does</i> ask is far more unsettling. In the final scenes of the series, Grace speaks in narration, considering the ways she&rsquo;s changed her story, in small but crucial ways, to please and assuage the guilt of the men in her life. &ldquo;A little white lie is a small price to pay for peace and quiet,&rdquo; she says, as the camera cuts to a shot of her in a field, seemingly looking off into the distance, wondering at her own actions. But Grace isn&rsquo;t looking at her past. She&rsquo;s looking &mdash; unwavering, unrepentantly &mdash; straight at us. &#x25CF;</p>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, Netflix&#x26;rsquo;s new six-episode adaptation of the novel by Margaret Atwood, opens in a way that&#x26;rsquo;ll make you think you&#x26;rsquo;re watching &#x3C;i&#x3E;Masterpiece Theater&#x3C;/i&#x3E;: credits running over images of household objects and faded drawings, paired with a mournful violin score. But as with so much of Atwood&#x26;rsquo;s work, the setting is a subterfuge, one of many ways that Atwood cloaks the central themes of her work: namely, the various emotionally and psychologically violent ways that women react to living under patriarchy.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Atwood&#x26;rsquo;s novel is a piece of historical fiction, rooted in the story of &#x26;ldquo;famous murderess&#x26;rdquo; Grace Marks, who, along with fellow servant James McDermott, was convicted in 1843 of murdering Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. Marks was sentenced to life, while McDermott was hanged. Atwood&#x26;rsquo;s novel and the miniseries tell the story of the crime, but frame it as more than a murder mystery &#x26;mdash; it&#x26;rsquo;s also an exploration of how women cope with years of accumulated and sublimated rage.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Handmaid&#x26;rsquo;s Tale&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, Hulu&#x26;rsquo;s recent Emmy-winning adaptation of another Atwood novel, patriarchy is stretched to a dystopian dimension, with fertile women made to serve as childbearing chattel for those in power. The women affected by this scenario process their rage in various ways: The handmaids are assembled and compelled to beat men accused of sex crimes, while the complicit wives vent the horror of their situations by physically and emotionally abusing the handmaids, the only people over whom they wield power.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, the setting is less explicitly dystopian, ostensibly clothed in soothing tones of a historical drama where servants are pleasant and well-spoken, masters are benign, and the world is good. But the world was not good at all for an Irish immigrant servant in the 19th century, and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is one of the select onscreen depictions of the Victorian era that acknowledges as much.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Such portrayals usually employ a sort of filmic &#x26;ldquo;social realism,&#x26;rdquo; dramatizing poverty and inequality in a way that keeps it at a safe distance from the viewer. Don&#x26;rsquo;t worry, these texts suggest: Things sucked then, but think of how much less they suck now. But &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, and the insidious effects of patriarchy that it portrays, feels inextricable from our present.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It&#x26;rsquo;s not just that Grace &#x26;mdash; as an immigrant, and a servant, and a woman &#x26;mdash; lacks power. It&#x26;rsquo;s that those who do have power in her world exploit the imbalance in horrific ways, to the extent that she&#x26;rsquo;s driven to her own act of horror in order to end it. That act isn&#x26;rsquo;t portrayed as vicarious wish fulfillment, or cathartic in any way. Instead, it&#x26;rsquo;s a testament to what women are taught to tolerate &#x26;mdash; both in Grace&#x26;rsquo;s time and today &#x26;mdash; until they break under the burden.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Sabrina Lantos/Netflix&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;Grace&#x26;rsquo;s childhood, which she narrates in measured, careful tones, was marked by quotidian tragedy and suffering: She was one of eight children; she watched her mother die at sea as they crossed from Ireland to Canada. Her drunken father abuses her, calls her a whore, and forces her to leave the family to go to work &#x26;mdash; commanding her to return her wages for him to drink away. She finds work as a maid, in households where the sons and fathers treat female servants as sexual playthings; &#x26;ldquo;there are some masters who think you owe them service 24 hours a day, and that you should do the main work flat on your back,&#x26;rdquo; she tells the doctor. Like other women of her age and station, Grace lives in terror that an unwanted pregnancy, the result of such unwanted but unrefusable advances, will lead to her ruin &#x26;mdash; which is precisely what happens to her best and only friend, who dies after a back alley abortion.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Atwood first wrote about Grace Marks &#x26;mdash; who became a vivid fixture in the Canadian imaginary over the course of her trial &#x26;mdash; in &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Journals of Susanna&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, a poetry collection published in 1970. But the character stayed with her. In 1997, Atwood returned to Grace Marks with &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, approaching her story through the plot device of a fictional doctor, newly enlightened by the nascent principles of psychology, attempting to determine whether or not Grace had indeed committed the murders or was subject to momentary insanity.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The book mixes Grace&#x26;rsquo;s conversations with the doctor with her internal meditation on their interactions and her recollections of the past. The miniseries, which was adapted by filmmaker Sarah Polley, skillfully interweaves the three temporalities, underlining how women are taught to tell the stories of themselves and their trauma in ways that both titillate and exonerate the listener.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Those two elements are the foundation of the &#x26;ldquo;true crime&#x26;rdquo; genre, whose most gripping stories are those in which people enact the unspeakable and scandalous. That means sex crimes, of course, but also crimes that demonstrate dominion &#x26;mdash; men who annihilate women; women who fight back against men. The &#x26;ldquo;facts&#x26;rdquo; of a crime are embroidered with excuses, motives, and speculation that say more about the audience and their needs than those of the perpetrators or victims. &#x26;ldquo;Real life&#x26;rdquo; becomes &#x26;ldquo;true crime&#x26;rdquo; when it is turned into a narrative with a logical motivation, rising climax, graphic event, righteous capture, and justice served.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yet Polley &#x26;mdash; who worked closely with Atwood in her adaptation, along with director Mary Harron &#x26;mdash; refuses to follow those usual tenets. &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E; becomes a meditation on the way true crime narratives are formed, but it also explodes the existing narrative around Grace herself. Without giving away any spoilers, it&#x26;rsquo;s clear that Grace has sublimated the rage of living under patriarchy, but it&#x26;rsquo;s unclear how, exactly, that manifested &#x26;mdash; and whether psychology is even equipped to understand the complex processes that occur over the course of decades of repressed trauma.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Unlike most true crime narratives, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E; promises and proffers little in the way of concrete answers. Instead, it poses a series of open questions: How does constant surveillance condition behavior? How do &#x26;ldquo;good&#x26;rdquo; men become party to the actions of the bad ones? How do women internalize the idea that other women &#x26;mdash; especially those in power &#x26;mdash; will never truly be their allies? &#x3C;i&#x3E;What is survivable?&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Jan Thijs / Netflix&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;These questions hover around Grace&#x26;rsquo;s story, but they&#x26;rsquo;re no less pertinent today. Atwood has never been cagey about the fact that her &#x26;ldquo;historical&#x26;rdquo; and dystopian novels are simply refractions of current issues, especially those facing women. And while it&#x26;rsquo;s happenstance that &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E; will (re)enter public consciousness amid an avalanche of allegations against men who have exploited their power to abuse, harass, or otherwise violate women, those allegations and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E; are simply two different vantages of the same reality &#x26;mdash; in which patriarchy is never not in the process of finding ways to sustain itself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;That word &#x26;mdash; &#x3C;i&#x3E;patriarchy &#x26;mdash;&#x3C;/i&#x3E; has become both overfreighted and evacuated of meaning; it&#x26;rsquo;s become the sort of SJW rhetoric that makes bros shut down and stop listening. But patriarchy isn&#x26;rsquo;t a feminist buzzword. It simply describes the organizing social principle of our world, in which men have held and continue to control the levers of power. Men largely decide what is legal and what is ethical. Men lead the vast majority of businesses and occupy the majority of offices in local, state, and federal government. Men make considerably more money. Which isn&#x26;rsquo;t to suggest that women lack power altogether; rather, it&#x26;rsquo;s to emphasize that the majority of power is still held by men, and as a result, women find themselves in the position of constantly negotiating that power.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Of course, not all men abuse their power, and some men are abused. But as both &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E; and the specifics of recent stories from accusers make clear, men and women alike become ready (if sometimes unconscious) accessories to interactions, relationships, and ideologies that keep patriarchy in place. Harvey Weinstein&#x26;rsquo;s assistants, for example, helped set &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories&#x22;&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;honey pots&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for the women he wished to prey upon; Grace&#x26;rsquo;s mistresses, terrified of losing their own limited place of power, spite and degrade her.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;That&#x26;rsquo;s what power does, as Lainey Gossip &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.laineygossip.com/harvey-weinstein-s-bullsh-t-apology-and-victim-attacks-after-NYT-sexual-harassment-allegations/48107&#x22;&#x3E;wrote&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in regard to her own role in keeping the rumors about Weinstein under wraps: &#x26;ldquo;It corrupts both the people who have it and the people who are subject to it. For those who have it, it becomes a weapon against the weak. And for the weak, it limits their freedom, it compels them to compromise, and in compromising, they become an accessory to that gun, the silencer that&#x26;rsquo;s attached to it.&#x26;rdquo; The women involved aren&#x26;rsquo;t innocent. But it&#x26;rsquo;s patriarchy and its privileges &#x26;mdash; not the women themselves &#x26;mdash; who are the root of the problem.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;That&#x26;rsquo;s an idea that &#x3C;i&#x3E;Mindhunter&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; another Netflix show about the true crime stories we tell ourselves &#x26;mdash; explores, however obliquely, in its first episode. The main character, a young FBI agent in the 1970s, grapples with a new &#x26;ldquo;type&#x26;rdquo; of crime that resists old classifications and understandings. His grad student girlfriend asks if he&#x26;rsquo;s ever heard of the work of (now canonical) sociologist &#x26;Eacute;mile Durkheim, who, as she puts it, was &#x26;ldquo;one of the first to suggest that criminality is a response when something&#x26;rsquo;s wrong with society.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Put differently, &#x3C;i&#x3E;crime&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; or transgression against social norms &#x26;mdash; occurs when those social norms are incorrect, under threat, or no longer make sense. Within this paradigm, Grace&#x26;rsquo;s violence might be immoral, but it is a logical response to patriarchy, and the only resistance of which she was capable. That idea is revealed gradually, but it is not treated as revelation. It is not a question answered; it is a given.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The question that &#x3C;i&#x3E;Alias Grace&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x3C;i&#x3E;does&#x3C;/i&#x3E; ask is far more unsettling. In the final scenes of the series, Grace speaks in narration, considering the ways she&#x26;rsquo;s changed her story, in small but crucial ways, to please and assuage the guilt of the men in her life. &#x26;ldquo;A little white lie is a small price to pay for peace and quiet,&#x26;rdquo; she says, as the camera cuts to a shot of her in a field, seemingly looking off into the distance, wondering at her own actions. But Grace isn&#x26;rsquo;t looking at her past. She&#x26;rsquo;s looking &#x26;mdash; unwavering, unrepentantly &#x26;mdash; straight at us. &#x26;#x25CF;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

    <media:description type="html">Nicole Krauss&#x27;s new novel &#x3C;i&#x3E;Forest Dark&#x3C;/i&#x3E; follows the separate lives of two characters each going through a stagnating rough patch as they travel from their homes in New York City to Tel Aviv. Jules Epstein is a retired lawyer in his sixties whose 30-plus year marriage has recently ended at around the same time he&#x27;s lost both of his parents. Unmoored, he starts randomly dispensing with his vast wealth and winds up in Tel Aviv on a pilgrimage to find a way to memorialize his parents. Nicole is a Brooklyn-based writer and mother of two whose marriage has all but fallen apart. She goes to Tel Aviv, a place she&#x27;s visited yearly her entire life, to try to break through a bad case of writer&#x27;s block. Set to the backdrop of the Tel Aviv Hilton, both characters embark on unexpected journeys of transformation and self-discovery. Krauss expertly intertwines musings on theology and the life of Franz Kafka in this beautifully written follow-up to the National Book Award finalist &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Great House&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. &#x2014;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/JessicaSimeone&#x22;&#x3E;Jessica Simeone&#x3C;/a&#x3E;

    <media:description type="html">I felt suspended the entire time I read &#x3C;i&#x3E;Nomadland&#x3C;/i&#x3E; by journalist Jessica Bruder. The book tells the stories of workampers &#x2014; a growing, albeit still largely invisible, population of American senior citizens who have rid themselves of mortgages and rent, and taken to life on the road. Reading about Bruder&#x27;s central character Linda May as she is pushed out of job after job, moves into an RV, and connects with a veritable tribe through short-term and scattered work at Amazon, state parks, and private farms, kept me perpetually hovering between two extremes &#x2014; terrified of ending up with the same fate, and energized to buy my own trailer and shake loose the chains of materialism. What makes Linda&#x27;s story so poignant is its resistance to categorization. She and her friends aren&#x27;t homeless; they&#x27;re houseless. They reject capitalism, but their travels are determined by available work. They embrace their freedom, but they live in a nearly constant fear of &#x22;the knock&#x22; &#x2014; or, police coming to ask what they&#x27;re up to. It&#x27;s complicated. But it&#x27;s impossible to read this book without being moved to question your own comforts and necessities, to consider what a meaningful life comprises, and how our society hinders the pursuit of it. &#x2014;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/AriannaRebolini&#x22;&#x3E;Arianna Rebolini&#x3C;/a&#x3E;

Written with deep empathy and vivid characters who feel true to life, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Little Fires Everywhere&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is a captivating, insightful examination of motherhood, identity, family, privilege, perfectionism, obsession, and the secrets about ourselves we try to hide. &#x2014;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/jarry&#x22;&#x3E;Jarry Lee&#x3C;/a&#x3E;

    <media:description type="html">&#x3C;i&#x3E;Five-Carat Soul&#x3C;/i&#x3E; by James McBride covers a lot of ground, all of it unpredictable, exhilarating, and, often, hilarious. The short stories bounce from one unlikely protagonist to the next &#x2014; from the antique toy dealer chasing a legendary train set owned by Robert E. Lee, to a captive lion making sense of the hierarchy of the zoo, to the one and only Abraham Lincoln &#x2014; and each story, despite the foreignness of its characters&#x27; circumstances, expertly weaves in such timeless themes as power and identity. McBride&#x27;s writing vibrates with so much life that sometimes I found myself reading the sentences aloud because thinking them wasn&#x27;t enough. I loved these stories individually; all together they make for a wild and utterly delightful ride. &#x2014;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/ariannarebolini&#x22;&#x3E;Arianna Rebolini&#x3C;/a&#x3E;

    <media:description type="html">Barely into the first story of Carmen Machado&#x27;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Her Body and Other Parties&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, I was certain this writer was about to explode everything I thought a short story had to be &#x2014; and I was right. Machado&#x27;s sharp, eerie, and often hilarious stories experiment with format in a way that feels genuinely new, dropping in theatrical asides to the reader, or structuring a narrative around &#x3C;i&#x3E;Law and Order&#x3C;/i&#x3E; episode titles. Their darkness is playful until it&#x27;s not, and that tipping point happens whenever the reader realizes the surrealist nightmares Machado has built around her female protagonists &#x2014; worlds in which women&#x27;s bodies are infected by the trauma they&#x27;ve witnessed or made vulnerable by an epidemic of becoming ethereal &#x2014; aren&#x27;t quite so fantastical at their cores. Reading Machado is thrilling, and the rush of that experience begs to be announced and shared. I kept finding myself wanting to turn to the stranger commuting next to me, tug their shirt, and be like, &#x22;THIS PARAGRAPH, THOUGH?!?!&#x22; Consider this review me tugging your shirt, and urging you to read along. &#x2013;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/AriannaRebolini&#x22;&#x3E;Arianna Rebolini&#x3C;/a&#x3E;

    <media:description type="html">&#x3C;i&#x3E;Turtles All The Way Down&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is John Green&#x2019;s first novel since his massively successful hit &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Fault in Our Stars&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, and on the surface, it has all the ingredients of a typical John Green novel: loss, eccentric teenagers, adventure, young love. The story follows Aza and her best friend Daisy as they search for information regarding the disappearance of a local billionaire in exchange for a $100,000 reward. But the plot isn&#x2019;t what drives the book; rather, it&#x2019;s Aza&#x2019;s struggle with OCD, which for her manifests in &#x201C;thought spirals&#x201D; that she can&#x2019;t seem to escape. The time we spend inside Aza&#x2019;s mind is both the most fascinating and difficult part of the book to read. Often, words can fall short when trying to describe what it really feels like to have mental health issues, but the way Green, who lives with OCD himself, manages to explain Aza&#x2019;s all-consuming thoughts makes you feel like you&#x2019;re right in the middle of her thought spirals, too. The ending will stop you in your tracks, leaving you both devastated and hopeful at the same time. You don&#x27;t need to have what Aza refers to as &#x22;invasive&#x22; thoughts to empathize with what she&#x27;s going through &#x2014; anyone who&#x27;s experienced how scary it can be when thoughts take on a life of their own will feel an instant connection to this gripping novel. &#x2013;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/cieravelarde&#x22;&#x3E;Ciera Velarde&#x3C;/a&#x3E;

They also cover a lot of ground &#x2014; the struggle of being an artist who has to balance work with day jobs, the awkwardness of dating, the ups and downs of navigating a relationship with parents as an adult, and the power in turning being alone from something to lament into something worth celebrating.

 <p>All families in distress try to shield their children first. </p>






<p>The diversity immigrant visa program offers 55,000 green cards every year to people from countries with low emigration rates to the United States. It&rsquo;s referred to as the green card lottery, although that name implies a free-for-all, which isn&rsquo;t quite the case. The current version of the system was enshrined into law with the Immigration Act of 1990.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/01/diversity-visa-irish-history-215776">a version of the diversity lottery</a> has existed since the 1970s and &rsquo;80s, when 10,000 special visas were made available to immigrants who had been &ldquo;adversely affected&rdquo; by immigration reform. Under the new system that prioritized family, employment, and humanitarian cases, Irish and Italian immigrants found themselves shut out. The diversity lottery was a way to draw immigrants who might not be a priority under the new criteria, and whose countries had not met their immigration caps.</p><p>The green cards are only available to people who meet certain educational or professional requirements, and applications still have to pass the standards established for all immigrants &mdash; after submitting her documents, my mother had to sit for a health exam and an interview, a process that took over a year. As a result of the stringent criteria, most applications get thrown out of consideration. But the mechanism for selecting applicants who will be interviewed is random, like a lottery.</p><p>After the Uzbekistani native who killed eight people in Manhattan Monday was found to be a recipient of one of these green cards, President Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/politics/donald-trump-chuck-schumer-nyc-attack/index.html">called</a> for the program&rsquo;s end.</p><p>Serbia in 1999 was as turbulent as any country on the current travel-ban list. The military and government led by Slobodan Milo&scaron;evi&#x107; were guilty of ethnic cleansing &mdash; a term that doesn&rsquo;t do enough to describe the rape and murder of the region&rsquo;s minority Muslim population. On top of all of that, we were actively at war with the United States and NATO, which had imposed sanctions first, and then started to drop bombs in order to deter the genocide. Still, Serbia was included in the list of countries eligible for the diversity lottery, showing a willingness on the United States&rsquo; part to distinguish between the actual perpetrators of violence and the victims on all sides caught in a war they didn&rsquo;t want.</p><p>The lottery was, my mother felt, the best chance to get me out of a period of war that had lasted nearly a decade, and was only escalating. She had heard rumors of this visa from relatives who already lived abroad. She sent in her application and crossed her fingers.</p><p>Back then, just two years after the program was started in 1995, ours was one of 4.7 million entries to the lottery, but the system has only gotten more competitive. In 2015, there were 14 million entries. In 2012, an immigrant from Serbia would have had just a 1.5% chance of winning a green card. Now <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adolfoflores/trump-calls-for-ending-diversity-visa-program-terrorist?utm_term=.ylrAQNle#.qjpe03KM">most winners of the lottery</a> are from Asia and Africa.</p><p>On our last night in Serbia, while walking home with my grandmother, I waved to a friend of mine passing by and told her I&rsquo;d see her later in the bomb shelter. I, of course, didn&rsquo;t realize the gravity of my words, but they were enough to drive my grandmother to tears. When I was woken up again that night, I expected another run to the basement. But I was stuffed into a car instead, along with our suitcases, and told we were going on a trip.</p><p>They couldn&rsquo;t tell me the truth for fear that I would volunteer that information to any authorities who stopped us. But we had won our green cards, and the trip was to America. My grandparents drove us to the Hungarian border, where my mother, a physician, told authorities that we were visiting relatives in Hungary. She feared she wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to leave the country, as doctors were scarce and in high demand amid the bombings.</p><p>Once we were over the border, in a van to catch a flight in Budapest, my mother finally told me we were leaving our home country for good. I was relieved. I told her that it was a smart move, that &ldquo;they probably won&rsquo;t bomb us in their own country.&rdquo;</p><p>After we arrived in California to live with my aunt, I hoarded snack-size bags of chips under my bed because I was still afraid of being hungry. My mother was bombarded with the well-meaning questions typically lobbed at immigrants: Where&rsquo;s your accent from? How do you pronounce that name?</p><p>But I flourished. I learned English, speaking it in broken pieces at school just like my classmates from Mexico, Korea, and the Philippines. I loved it enough to study it in school, and went to my dream universities to pursue my studies further.</p><p>Young enough to lose my accent, I blended seamlessly into the American social fabric. My maiden name and my nose sometimes gave me away, but no one ever threatened my citizenship or my safety in this country, or scooted away from me on public transit, or implied that the program that eventually gave me citizenship is &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;</p><p>I have asked how I&rsquo;m different from the immigrants that this administration would like to ban from entering the United States. Given the state of my home country at the time of my emigration, it seems that 5-year-old me should have been deemed just as dangerous as a Syrian child now.</p><p>The answer is always the same: &ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t mean you.&rdquo;</p><p>It can&rsquo;t mean anything other than my white skin and birthplace in a majority-Christian nation, the qualities that gave me the ability to blend here, make me a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; immigrant.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s ludicrous to assume that if the lottery wasn&rsquo;t available, my family wouldn&rsquo;t have looked for other ways to leave the country. Decent parents will protect their children in any way possible, whether that means immigrating legally or illegally, and the lottery is another legal channel for people like my mother. We got lucky, but we&rsquo;re not special.</p><p>There are honest critiques of the program. For one, how fair is it when hopeful immigrants from Central and South America are waiting years to reunite with their families? And those critiques are worth addressing. But using fearmongering as an excuse to completely dismantle the lottery does not do that.</p><p>Like all of our immigration policies, the green card lottery has allowed exponentially more people like me into the United States than people like Sayfullo Saipov. To end the program and close ourselves off indicates we&rsquo;re not interested in any more diversity, thanks. And as part of a larger trend toward closed borders, it shows we&rsquo;ve lost the collective empathy that treated me as more than a daughter of an unstable homeland. &#x25CF;</p>

The current version of the system was enshrined into law with the Immigration Act of 1990.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/01/diversity-visa-irish-history-215776&#x22;&#x3E;a version of the diversity lottery&#x3C;/a&#x3E; has existed since the 1970s and &#x26;rsquo;80s, when 10,000 special visas were made available to immigrants who had been &#x26;ldquo;adversely affected&#x26;rdquo; by immigration reform. Under the new system that prioritized family, employment, and humanitarian cases, Irish and Italian immigrants found themselves shut out. The diversity lottery was a way to draw immigrants who might not be a priority under the new criteria, and whose countries had not met their immigration caps.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The green cards are only available to people who meet certain educational or professional requirements, and applications still have to pass the standards established for all immigrants &#x26;mdash; after submitting her documents, my mother had to sit for a health exam and an interview, a process that took over a year. As a result of the stringent criteria, most applications get thrown out of consideration. But the mechanism for selecting applicants who will be interviewed is random, like a lottery.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;After the Uzbekistani native who killed eight people in Manhattan Monday was found to be a recipient of one of these green cards, President Trump &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/politics/donald-trump-chuck-schumer-nyc-attack/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;called&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for the program&#x26;rsquo;s end.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Serbia in 1999 was as turbulent as any country on the current travel-ban list. The military and government led by Slobodan Milo&#x26;scaron;evi&#x26;#x107; were guilty of ethnic cleansing &#x26;mdash; a term that doesn&#x26;rsquo;t do enough to describe the rape and murder of the region&#x26;rsquo;s minority Muslim population. On top of all of that, we were actively at war with the United States and NATO, which had imposed sanctions first, and then started to drop bombs in order to deter the genocide. Still, Serbia was included in the list of countries eligible for the diversity lottery, showing a willingness on the United States&#x26;rsquo; part to distinguish between the actual perpetrators of violence and the victims on all sides caught in a war they didn&#x26;rsquo;t want.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The lottery was, my mother felt, the best chance to get me out of a period of war that had lasted nearly a decade, and was only escalating. She had heard rumors of this visa from relatives who already lived abroad. She sent in her application and crossed her fingers.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Back then, just two years after the program was started in 1995, ours was one of 4.7 million entries to the lottery, but the system has only gotten more competitive. In 2015, there were 14 million entries. In 2012, an immigrant from Serbia would have had just a 1.5% chance of winning a green card. Now &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/adolfoflores/trump-calls-for-ending-diversity-visa-program-terrorist?utm_term=.ylrAQNle#.qjpe03KM&#x22;&#x3E;most winners of the lottery&#x3C;/a&#x3E; are from Asia and Africa.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On our last night in Serbia, while walking home with my grandmother, I waved to a friend of mine passing by and told her I&#x26;rsquo;d see her later in the bomb shelter. I, of course, didn&#x26;rsquo;t realize the gravity of my words, but they were enough to drive my grandmother to tears. When I was woken up again that night, I expected another run to the basement. But I was stuffed into a car instead, along with our suitcases, and told we were going on a trip.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;They couldn&#x26;rsquo;t tell me the truth for fear that I would volunteer that information to any authorities who stopped us. But we had won our green cards, and the trip was to America. My grandparents drove us to the Hungarian border, where my mother, a physician, told authorities that we were visiting relatives in Hungary. She feared she wouldn&#x26;rsquo;t be allowed to leave the country, as doctors were scarce and in high demand amid the bombings.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Once we were over the border, in a van to catch a flight in Budapest, my mother finally told me we were leaving our home country for good. I was relieved. I told her that it was a smart move, that &#x26;ldquo;they probably won&#x26;rsquo;t bomb us in their own country.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;After we arrived in California to live with my aunt, I hoarded snack-size bags of chips under my bed because I was still afraid of being hungry. My mother was bombarded with the well-meaning questions typically lobbed at immigrants: Where&#x26;rsquo;s your accent from? How do you pronounce that name?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But I flourished. I learned English, speaking it in broken pieces at school just like my classmates from Mexico, Korea, and the Philippines. I loved it enough to study it in school, and went to my dream universities to pursue my studies further.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Young enough to lose my accent, I blended seamlessly into the American social fabric. My maiden name and my nose sometimes gave me away, but no one ever threatened my citizenship or my safety in this country, or scooted away from me on public transit, or implied that the program that eventually gave me citizenship is &#x26;ldquo;bad.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have asked how I&#x26;rsquo;m different from the immigrants that this administration would like to ban from entering the United States. Given the state of my home country at the time of my emigration, it seems that 5-year-old me should have been deemed just as dangerous as a Syrian child now.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The answer is always the same: &#x26;ldquo;Well, we don&#x26;rsquo;t mean you.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It can&#x26;rsquo;t mean anything other than my white skin and birthplace in a majority-Christian nation, the qualities that gave me the ability to blend here, make me a &#x26;ldquo;safe&#x26;rdquo; immigrant.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But it&#x26;rsquo;s ludicrous to assume that if the lottery wasn&#x26;rsquo;t available, my family wouldn&#x26;rsquo;t have looked for other ways to leave the country. Decent parents will protect their children in any way possible, whether that means immigrating legally or illegally, and the lottery is another legal channel for people like my mother. We got lucky, but we&#x26;rsquo;re not special.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are honest critiques of the program. For one, how fair is it when hopeful immigrants from Central and South America are waiting years to reunite with their families? And those critiques are worth addressing. But using fearmongering as an excuse to completely dismantle the lottery does not do that.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Like all of our immigration policies, the green card lottery has allowed exponentially more people like me into the United States than people like Sayfullo Saipov. To end the program and close ourselves off indicates we&#x26;rsquo;re not interested in any more diversity, thanks. And as part of a larger trend toward closed borders, it shows we&#x26;rsquo;ve lost the collective empathy that treated me as more than a daughter of an unstable homeland. &#x26;#x25CF;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p><b>There&rsquo;s a scene</b> in <i>John Wick 2</i>, where Keanu Reeves puts on a shirt. Watching the movie together some months ago, the two authors of this piece found each other&rsquo;s gaze in the dark of the theater, eyes shining. We both love Keanu Reeves, and have done so for <i>years.</i> In the looks we shared that day at the cinema was something kind of beautiful: Our lust for him is not new, but the joy came in thirsting for him together. We didn&rsquo;t need words. We were performing our lust for this mutual thirst object, and there was no one to judge us, or question us. We could revel in this moment (honestly, the whole film), free of interruption. Thirst is life-enriching, especially when it is shared.</p><p>So &mdash; what <i>is</i> thirst?</p><p>In scholarly fashion it is unabashed, guilt-free desire for a person. It is also disgustingly specific, deeply recognizable, and a lot of fun&#33;</p><p>We are writers who met on the internet, dissecting popular culture and finding kinship in obvious and unexpected ways, by bonding over our thirst for various famous people, via pithy tweets. (Bless the career and face of Keanu Reeves &mdash; he came up early and often.) A Southerner from the United States and a black Brit, our backgrounds could not have been more opposite, yet we connected through the performance of desire, silly and serious all at once.</p><p>Talking about who we fancy is obviously a very shallow pursuit, but it is also a deeply human one. Thirsting is revelatory on a cultural level, and when it comes to lust, we must remember that it is all learned &mdash; taught and reinforced from the time we are first able to process texts. It&rsquo;s about so much more than a square jaw or the shape of a curl. To talk about who we fancy is to talk about politics, art, economics, migration patterns, history, and of course, our loins. Sure, we traded Tumblr links and gifs about our thirst objects, but we also spoke openly about how we came to arrive at this place. How our histories &mdash; which inevitably intersect with pop culture &mdash; allowed us to arrive on a social media platform, sweating and giggling over people who will probably never know we exist. Our thirst journeys are just as important as the objects themselves, which brings us to our brand new podcast, <i>Thirst Aid Kit</i>.</p><hr /><p>First of all, thank you: We know it&rsquo;s a great name (shoutout to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tylersorensen">Tyler</a>, who came up with it).<br /></p><p>Secondly, you should listen and subscribe to it&#33; We will be tackling the very important issue of dudes we fancy. (The two of us are straight, cis, black women, so we&rsquo;re largely talking about desire as viewed through that very specific lens). <i>Thirst Aid Kit</i> will be like a vacation, but a working holiday, because amid the lols (and there will be so many&#33;) we aim to unpack the politics of desire &mdash; the hows and whys, the ins and outs, the birds and bees, whatever &mdash; while laughing at every mildly dirty innuendo that crosses our paths. We happen to think no one has a handle on thirst quite like women, and as a group, lusting out loud &mdash; explicitly, with joy and humor&mdash; is still relatively new. Expressing lust is wildly cathartic and normalizing, and we think it should be celebrated.</p><p>We will be tracing our history of crushes and fancies from childhood cartoons all the way to contemporary superhero films. Who did we outgrow? Who remains an enduring entry on our List of Hot Dudes? What happens when Forever Bae becomes a Problematic Fave? We tackle all these questions and more with humor and expertise.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what we want <i>Thirst Aid Kit</i> to be:</p><ul><li><p>(Largely) no-guilt. This <i>is</i> fun&#33; And funny&#33;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>But more than that, <i>TAK</i> will be a chance to delve a little deeper, and that might be uncomfortable at times, and it may reveal some shit that makes you question your &ldquo;preferences.&rdquo; This is a good thing&#33; We&rsquo;ll be looking at internalized biases and how they affect us &mdash; all the while being fun&#33; Or not, sometimes&#33;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>We have some <i>amazing</i> guests lined up. And the conversations that we have with them will serve to highlight, educate, elucidate, (hopefully) scandalize, and definitely amuse you.</p></li><li><p>There. Will. Be. Fanfiction.</p></li></ul><p>Of course, thirst is <i>literally</i> not exhaustive. It is a renewable source, able to transmogrify into whatever it needs to become. <i>TAK</i> is a judgment-free zone. There&rsquo;s no room in our hearts to disparage anyone for their childhood crushes or current-day fantasies. Thirst is fluid. As our thinking and maturity changes, so does who we desire. Thirst Aid Kit will be an ongoing conversation, between the two of us, and of course, our listeners, in which we note, recognize, and analyze patterns of desire, and asking what that means i.e. interrogate our choices. And those choices will absolutely look at race, nationality, accents, voices, height, talent, and body of work. All these things affect how and who we fancy. We aren&rsquo;t born liking who we like, and it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge all the factors that create desire, from the obvious to the overlooked, while having a good time.</p><p>Ultimately, we are excited by the chances this podcast will be giving us: a platform to be a little frivolous, the chance to explore the things that seems fixed in place and perhaps shift them a little, the opportunity to bring to your attention the talented hotties we love, all that good stuff. We&rsquo;ll help you find new crushes and validate your old ones. You&rsquo;ll never feel so seen as when you tune in to <i>Thirst Aid Kit</i>. Join us on a (lightly smutty) magic school bus as we learn about ourselves along the way. Let your lust live out loud.</p><p><b><i>Listen and subscribe to</i></b> <b>Thirst Aid Kit</b> <b><i>on</i></b> <b><i><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/thirst-aid-kit/id1298802532?mt=2">Apple Podcasts</a></i></b><b><i>,</i></b> <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/panoply/thirst-aid-kit"><b><i>Stitcher</i></b></a><b><i>,</i></b> <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Iabzdu3h2n2xifxcudrhm6a5wj4"><b><i>Google Play</i></b></a><b><i>,</i></b> <b><i><a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/thirst-aid-kit-28573311/">iHeartRadio</a></i></b><b><i>,</i></b> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7zuxJZkpFwNAQN8GN6Hyda"><b><i>Spotify</i></b></a><b><i>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</i></b></p>

<p><b>Earlier this week,</b> BuzzFeed News published <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/anthony-rapp-kevin-spacey-made-sexual-advance-when-i-was-14">an account</a> of Kevin Spacey making a sexual advance on then-14-year-old <i>Star Trek: Discovery</i> actor Anthony Rapp. Spacey, who had been contacted but declined to comment before the article was published, reacted to it by <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/924848412842971136">tweeting</a> out a combined apology and coming-out statement that seemingly attempted to reframe the story.</p><p>Spacey described himself as being &ldquo;beyond horrified to hear [Rapp&#39;s] story," adding, &ldquo;I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.&rdquo; But after the apology, he also finally moved out of the glass closet that he&rsquo;s been <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kevin-spacey-jokes-about-coming-out-of-the-closet-at-the-tony-awards">ambiguously</a> living in for years. &ldquo;I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man,&rdquo; the statement <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/30/560779174/kevin-spacey-apologizes-to-anthony-rapp-over-alleged-sexual-misconduct">reads</a>. &ldquo;I want to deal with this honestly and openly and that starts with examining my own behavior.&rdquo;</p><p>With his statement, Spacey attempted to create a sort of "rainbow shield" &mdash; strategically wielding his sexuality as a way of reasserting control over a potentially damaging story of alleged sexual misconduct. And, up to a point, it worked. &ldquo;Kevin Spacey Declares He Lives Life as a Gay Man,&rdquo; Reuters <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-vRkzmJqgVEJ:www.reuters.com/article/us-people-kevinspacey/actor-kevin-spacey-declares-he-lives-life-as-a-gay-man-idUSKBN1CZ0CQ%3Fref%3Dhvper.com+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">announced</a>. The original <a href="https://twitter.com/adamjohnsonnyc/status/924880039468036096">headline</a> of an ABC report read &ldquo;&lsquo;I choose now to live as a gay man&rsquo;: Kevin Spacey comes out in emotional tweet.&rdquo;</p><p>But the timing of Spacey&rsquo;s coming-out, after an allegation of sexual misconduct and during a moment of widespread conversation about gendered violence in Hollywood, was troubling. Spacey has quickly become the target of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html">online backlash</a> &mdash; including <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/zachary-quinto-speaks-out-against-spacey-on-twitter?utm_term=.olLP47NXjo#.otYz19EQwa">from other LGBT celebrities</a> who accused him of coming out in an attempt to deflect attention from Rapp&rsquo;s allegations &mdash; and <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/10/house-of-cards-production-shut-down-suspended-indefinitely-following-kevin-spacey-allegations-netflix-series-1202198465/">Netflix announced an indefinite suspension of the production of</a> <i>House of Cards</i>, <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/10/house-of-cards-production-shut-down-suspended-indefinitely-following-kevin-spacey-allegations-netflix-series-1202198465/">the show</a> Spacey stars in. Two more men have <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewchampion/a-man-says-he-woke-up-when-he-was-a-teenager-to-find-kevin?utm_term=.jgy2VNK6m1#.seY1jOJpLR">since come forward</a> with allegations of sexual harassment against Spacey.</p><p>Homophobia is still a real and pressing issue, permeating all levels of society. One cannot help but be deeply sympathetic to the horrors and paranoia that the closet breeds, and to the way that gossip has historically been used to blackmail and punish gay men, especially during the time when Kevin Spacey was growing up and establishing himself in Hollywood. But given the longstanding homophobic conflation of gayness and pedophilia, Spacey&rsquo;s statement itself &mdash; as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/kevin-spacey-vicious-lie-gay-men-accusation-attempted-sexual-assault">reaction</a> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-kevin-spaceys-coming-out-grossly-conflates-pedophilia-and-homosexuality">pieces</a> in the immediate aftermath have noted &mdash; reinforces a harmful stereotype about queer people by implicitly linking allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor to his gay male identity.</p><p>Ultimately, Spacey&rsquo;s statement serves as a reminder that the politics of coming out can&#39;t be separated from questions of class, race, gender, or even nation, and even those who may share a particular marginalized identity have different relationships to power. At this moment, when a &ldquo;respectable,&rdquo; straight-passing white gay billionaire like Peter Thiel declares his sexual identity to <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_us_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357">support white nationalism</a>, it has become clear that gay identity can be weaponized by the more privileged to uphold established power structures. Spacey&rsquo;s <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/270415-kevin-spacey-on-white-house-race-we-get-what-we-deserve">politics are not conservative</a>, but his strategic deployment of the rainbow shield aligns him with others who have wielded their gay identity in damaging ways.</p>











 





<p><b>Kevin Spacey is not</b> the first powerful closeted white man to strategically out himself when his power was imperiled. In 2004, New Jersey Governor James McGreevey was rocked by sexual harassment allegations from Golan Cipel, an Israeli man he had appointed as his homeland security adviser. While McGreevey dismissed Cipel&rsquo;s claims as an extortion plot, he resigned with a then-shocking coming-out speech.</p><p>McGreevey famously <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/12/mcgreevey.transcript/">declared</a>, &ldquo;And so my truth is that I am a gay American. And I am blessed to live in the greatest nation with the tradition of civil liberties, the greatest tradition of civil liberties in the world, in a country which provides so much to its people.&rdquo; Like Spacey, he emphasized honesty and truth. But because he was a politician rather than an actor, his statement linked his sexual identity to national belonging and specifically played into exceptionalist ideas about America as a land of liberty and plenty in order to affirm his belonging.</p>

<p>Using his identity in this way was still risky at a time when presidential candidates like George W. Bush were <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/inside-george-w-bushs-closet-108016">mobilizing sentiment against same-sex marriage</a> to win elections and the LGBT community&rsquo;s national standing was more precarious. To some extent, McGreevey&rsquo;s politics might have protected him from being outed. As blogger Michael Rogers <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=14212470&amp;ft=nprml&amp;f=14212475">told NPR</a> in 2007, &ldquo;People&#39;s sexuality is only fair game if it&#39;s in direct conflict to the public statements they make about political things such as policy or legislation that they&#39;re voting on.&rdquo; But gay activists were nonetheless troubled by the governor&rsquo;s speech.</p><p>"When Gov. McGreevey resigned I was not in disbelief that he came out, for many of us had already heard or knew,&rdquo; Steven Goldstein of Garden State Equality <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/a_decade_after_gov_jim_mcgreeveys_gay_american_speech.html">later said</a>. &ldquo;I was in disbelief and, frankly, angry that he invoked being gay as his exit strategy from the governorship." By the time of the release of the former governor&rsquo;s celebrity memoir in 2006, GQ magazine <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jim-mcgreevey-new-jersey-governor-gay">noted</a>: &ldquo;McGreevey&#39;s coming out was about nothing so much as changing the subject, saving his own ass, moving the public discourse away from the turmoil he had made of the governor&#39;s office and spinning it.&rdquo;</p><p>McGreevey&rsquo;s strategic use of coming out thrust him into a conversation about the commodification of gay identity that went on throughout the &lsquo;90s and aughts. These debates centered on the way gay identity became separated from the kind of queer politics that sought to deeply change social inequality. Terms like &ldquo;<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christiaan-rapcewicz/homonormativity-homonatio_b_6889606.html">homonormativity</a>&rdquo; captured a sense that this kind of radical vision was being replaced by assimilationist, rights-based, pro-capitalist politics that sought to empower the queer people who &mdash; for reasons of race, gender, ability, and citizenship &mdash; are most easily accommodated into mainstream society.</p>











 





<p><b>The strategic political</b> use of sexual identity has become a bigger, more mainstream story with the rise of Trump, as <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/heres-how-gay-republicans-are-brushing-off-trumps-latest?utm_term=.wc321EXNe3#.clxyZrwjPo">conservative white gay men</a> have used their gayness to promote white nationalistic politics and make its rhetoric more palatable. Perhaps the most famous example of this kind of accommodation was performed by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel at the Republican National Convention in July 2016, where he explicitly deployed his identity to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pinkwashing">pinkwash</a> Donald Trump as a gay-friendly candidate.</p><p>In his remarks, Thiel, like McGreevey, linked his gay identity to his Americanness, <a href="http://time.com/4417679/republican-convention-peter-thiel-transcript/">casting himself</a> as an immigrant made good &mdash; from Germany to Cleveland &mdash; with a special claim to national belonging. He then specifically invoked his gay identity to give the party an image of multiculturalism: &ldquo;Of course, every American has a unique identity,&rdquo; he told fellow Republicans and the nation at large. &ldquo;I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all I am proud to be an American.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; cisgender white gay men like Thiel who have been helping to uphold homophobic, racist, misogynist, and imperialist ends. Lesbian critic Camille Paglia was a &rsquo;90s pioneer of using her white queerness to argue <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974660,00.html">against multiculturalism</a> and eventually <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2009/09/paglias-a-birther-021461">support racist agendas</a>. Self-styled <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/06/28/what_happens_when_villains_become_the_most_visible_queers.html">&ldquo;dangerous faggot&rdquo; Milo Yiannopoulos</a> has been a prime appropriator of queer tactics in service of conservative and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism">white supremacist ends</a>. Even transgender celebrity <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/28/caitlyn-jenner-blasted-by-another-transgender-woman-over-her-donald-trump-support/">Caitlyn Jenner supported Trump and, much to the outrage of activists, tried to position herself as an advocate for trans people.</a> During his campaign, Trump happily <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/7/26/16034404/trump-lgbtq-rights">jumped on</a> gay nationalism to perform anti-Muslin fearmongering, claiming he would protect <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283498-trump-says-he-shamed-clinton-into-saying-radical-islam">American gays from homophobic Muslims</a>.</p><p>But Thiel is the most relevant example of someone strategically using the politics of coming out, specifically, to maintain his own power and damage the credibility of those who criticize him. Even before he became involved with Trump&rsquo;s campaign, he famously turned his supposed &ldquo;outing&rdquo; by Gawker into an opportunity to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html?_r=1">fund a $10 million takedown</a> of the website in the name of his own privacy. (Before its demise, Gawker had also been posting gossip about Spacey&rsquo;s sexual interest in men &mdash; some highlighting "aggressive" behavior and some merely speculating about his homosexuality. Spacey made it clear in 2010 that he resented this kind of questioning and gossip, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kevin-spacey-on-his-new-film-casino-jack-interview-and-trailer">accusing a Daily Beast reporter</a> who asked him whether he was gay of "using sexuality as a weapon" against him, emphasizing his "right to privacy.")</p><p>Kevin Spacey has long since invoked that &ldquo;right to privacy&rdquo; throughout his career to defer and evade discussions about his personal life and identity. There is nothing inherently wrong with that; Spacey is not a politician or pundit, and he has a right to perform his identity on whatever terms he&rsquo;s comfortable with. The academic critic Nicholas de Villiers has even coined the term <a href="http://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/afterthoughts-on-queer-opacity/">&ldquo;queer opacity&rdquo;</a> to refer to public figures who are neither inside nor outside the closet, but rather tease the public through ambiguous statements that resist attempts to elicit confessions or pin down identities. In some ways this has been Spacey&rsquo;s modus operandi. And yet now that his personal behavior is being questioned, Spacey is finally willing to turn the personal political, unambiguously stepping out as a &ldquo;gay man.&rdquo;</p><p>Spacey&rsquo;s coming-out is a complicated reminder of the way that those closest to institutional power and privilege &mdash; whether in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, or politics &mdash; have the luxury of choosing when to make gay identity political. And the choice is often not to use it in service of social change, but to protect personal or commercial interests. Rapp&rsquo;s account has started a difficult conversation, given that accusing gay men of sexual misconduct can be weaponized by anti-LGBT groups to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; that all queer people are deviants. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that the accusers in these cases are often queer people too: Rapp <a href="https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/out100-2010/2010/11/07/where-are-they-now-anthony-rapp">came out</a> in 1992, at a time when being openly gay as an actor could carry serious professional consequences. And the LGBT community at large still faces <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-assault-and-the-lgbt-community">high rates</a> of sexual harassment and assault. So this is a conversation worth having &mdash; and the backlash against Spacey within the LGBT community suggests it&rsquo;s only getting started. &#x25CF;</p><p><br /></p>

Spacey has quickly become the target of an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html&#x22;&#x3E;online backlash&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; including &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/zachary-quinto-speaks-out-against-spacey-on-twitter?utm_term=.olLP47NXjo#.otYz19EQwa&#x22;&#x3E;from other LGBT celebrities&#x3C;/a&#x3E; who accused him of coming out in an attempt to deflect attention from Rapp&#x26;rsquo;s allegations &#x26;mdash; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://deadline.com/2017/10/house-of-cards-production-shut-down-suspended-indefinitely-following-kevin-spacey-allegations-netflix-series-1202198465/&#x22;&#x3E;Netflix announced an indefinite suspension of the production of&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x3C;i&#x3E;House of Cards&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://deadline.com/2017/10/house-of-cards-production-shut-down-suspended-indefinitely-following-kevin-spacey-allegations-netflix-series-1202198465/&#x22;&#x3E;the show&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Spacey stars in. Two more men have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewchampion/a-man-says-he-woke-up-when-he-was-a-teenager-to-find-kevin?utm_term=.jgy2VNK6m1#.seY1jOJpLR&#x22;&#x3E;since come forward&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with allegations of sexual harassment against Spacey.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Homophobia is still a real and pressing issue, permeating all levels of society. One cannot help but be deeply sympathetic to the horrors and paranoia that the closet breeds, and to the way that gossip has historically been used to blackmail and punish gay men, especially during the time when Kevin Spacey was growing up and establishing himself in Hollywood. But given the longstanding homophobic conflation of gayness and pedophilia, Spacey&#x26;rsquo;s statement itself &#x26;mdash; as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/kevin-spacey-vicious-lie-gay-men-accusation-attempted-sexual-assault&#x22;&#x3E;reaction&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-kevin-spaceys-coming-out-grossly-conflates-pedophilia-and-homosexuality&#x22;&#x3E;pieces&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in the immediate aftermath have noted &#x26;mdash; reinforces a harmful stereotype about queer people by implicitly linking allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor to his gay male identity.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Ultimately, Spacey&#x26;rsquo;s statement serves as a reminder that the politics of coming out can&#x26;#39;t be separated from questions of class, race, gender, or even nation, and even those who may share a particular marginalized identity have different relationships to power. At this moment, when a &#x26;ldquo;respectable,&#x26;rdquo; straight-passing white gay billionaire like Peter Thiel declares his sexual identity to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_us_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357&#x22;&#x3E;support white nationalism&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it has become clear that gay identity can be weaponized by the more privileged to uphold established power structures. Spacey&#x26;rsquo;s &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/270415-kevin-spacey-on-white-house-race-we-get-what-we-deserve&#x22;&#x3E;politics are not conservative&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but his strategic deployment of the rainbow shield aligns him with others who have wielded their gay identity in damaging ways.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 





&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Kevin Spacey is not&#x3C;/b&#x3E; the first powerful closeted white man to strategically out himself when his power was imperiled. In 2004, New Jersey Governor James McGreevey was rocked by sexual harassment allegations from Golan Cipel, an Israeli man he had appointed as his homeland security adviser. While McGreevey dismissed Cipel&#x26;rsquo;s claims as an extortion plot, he resigned with a then-shocking coming-out speech.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;McGreevey famously &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/12/mcgreevey.transcript/&#x22;&#x3E;declared&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x26;ldquo;And so my truth is that I am a gay American. And I am blessed to live in the greatest nation with the tradition of civil liberties, the greatest tradition of civil liberties in the world, in a country which provides so much to its people.&#x26;rdquo; Like Spacey, he emphasized honesty and truth. But because he was a politician rather than an actor, his statement linked his sexual identity to national belonging and specifically played into exceptionalist ideas about America as a land of liberty and plenty in order to affirm his belonging.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Using his identity in this way was still risky at a time when presidential candidates like George W. Bush were &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/inside-george-w-bushs-closet-108016&#x22;&#x3E;mobilizing sentiment against same-sex marriage&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to win elections and the LGBT community&#x26;rsquo;s national standing was more precarious. To some extent, McGreevey&#x26;rsquo;s politics might have protected him from being outed. As blogger Michael Rogers &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=14212470&#x26;amp;ft=nprml&#x26;amp;f=14212475&#x22;&#x3E;told NPR&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in 2007, &#x26;ldquo;People&#x26;#39;s sexuality is only fair game if it&#x26;#39;s in direct conflict to the public statements they make about political things such as policy or legislation that they&#x26;#39;re voting on.&#x26;rdquo; But gay activists were nonetheless troubled by the governor&#x26;rsquo;s speech.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;When Gov. McGreevey resigned I was not in disbelief that he came out, for many of us had already heard or knew,&#x26;rdquo; Steven Goldstein of Garden State Equality &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/a_decade_after_gov_jim_mcgreeveys_gay_american_speech.html&#x22;&#x3E;later said&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. &#x26;ldquo;I was in disbelief and, frankly, angry that he invoked being gay as his exit strategy from the governorship.&#x22; By the time of the release of the former governor&#x26;rsquo;s celebrity memoir in 2006, GQ magazine &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.gq.com/story/jim-mcgreevey-new-jersey-governor-gay&#x22;&#x3E;noted&#x3C;/a&#x3E;: &#x26;ldquo;McGreevey&#x26;#39;s coming out was about nothing so much as changing the subject, saving his own ass, moving the public discourse away from the turmoil he had made of the governor&#x26;#39;s office and spinning it.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;McGreevey&#x26;rsquo;s strategic use of coming out thrust him into a conversation about the commodification of gay identity that went on throughout the &#x26;lsquo;90s and aughts. These debates centered on the way gay identity became separated from the kind of queer politics that sought to deeply change social inequality. Terms like &#x26;ldquo;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christiaan-rapcewicz/homonormativity-homonatio_b_6889606.html&#x22;&#x3E;homonormativity&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x26;rdquo; captured a sense that this kind of radical vision was being replaced by assimilationist, rights-based, pro-capitalist politics that sought to empower the queer people who &#x26;mdash; for reasons of race, gender, ability, and citizenship &#x26;mdash; are most easily accommodated into mainstream society.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 





&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;The strategic political&#x3C;/b&#x3E; use of sexual identity has become a bigger, more mainstream story with the rise of Trump, as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/heres-how-gay-republicans-are-brushing-off-trumps-latest?utm_term=.wc321EXNe3#.clxyZrwjPo&#x22;&#x3E;conservative white gay men&#x3C;/a&#x3E; have used their gayness to promote white nationalistic politics and make its rhetoric more palatable. Perhaps the most famous example of this kind of accommodation was performed by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel at the Republican National Convention in July 2016, where he explicitly deployed his identity to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pinkwashing&#x22;&#x3E;pinkwash&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Donald Trump as a gay-friendly candidate.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In his remarks, Thiel, like McGreevey, linked his gay identity to his Americanness, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://time.com/4417679/republican-convention-peter-thiel-transcript/&#x22;&#x3E;casting himself&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as an immigrant made good &#x26;mdash; from Germany to Cleveland &#x26;mdash; with a special claim to national belonging. He then specifically invoked his gay identity to give the party an image of multiculturalism: &#x26;ldquo;Of course, every American has a unique identity,&#x26;rdquo; he told fellow Republicans and the nation at large. &#x26;ldquo;I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all I am proud to be an American.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;And it&#x26;rsquo;s not just &#x26;ldquo;respectable&#x26;rdquo; cisgender white gay men like Thiel who have been helping to uphold homophobic, racist, misogynist, and imperialist ends. Lesbian critic Camille Paglia was a &#x26;rsquo;90s pioneer of using her white queerness to argue &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974660,00.html&#x22;&#x3E;against multiculturalism&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and eventually &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2009/09/paglias-a-birther-021461&#x22;&#x3E;support racist agendas&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Self-styled &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/06/28/what_happens_when_villains_become_the_most_visible_queers.html&#x22;&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;dangerous faggot&#x26;rdquo; Milo Yiannopoulos&#x3C;/a&#x3E; has been a prime appropriator of queer tactics in service of conservative and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism&#x22;&#x3E;white supremacist ends&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Even transgender celebrity &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/28/caitlyn-jenner-blasted-by-another-transgender-woman-over-her-donald-trump-support/&#x22;&#x3E;Caitlyn Jenner supported Trump and, much to the outrage of activists, tried to position herself as an advocate for trans people.&#x3C;/a&#x3E; During his campaign, Trump happily &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/7/26/16034404/trump-lgbtq-rights&#x22;&#x3E;jumped on&#x3C;/a&#x3E; gay nationalism to perform anti-Muslin fearmongering, claiming he would protect &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283498-trump-says-he-shamed-clinton-into-saying-radical-islam&#x22;&#x3E;American gays from homophobic Muslims&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But Thiel is the most relevant example of someone strategically using the politics of coming out, specifically, to maintain his own power and damage the credibility of those who criticize him. Even before he became involved with Trump&#x26;rsquo;s campaign, he famously turned his supposed &#x26;ldquo;outing&#x26;rdquo; by Gawker into an opportunity to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html?_r=1&#x22;&#x3E;fund a $10 million takedown&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the website in the name of his own privacy. (Before its demise, Gawker had also been posting gossip about Spacey&#x26;rsquo;s sexual interest in men &#x26;mdash; some highlighting &#x22;aggressive&#x22; behavior and some merely speculating about his homosexuality. Spacey made it clear in 2010 that he resented this kind of questioning and gossip, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.thedailybeast.com/kevin-spacey-on-his-new-film-casino-jack-interview-and-trailer&#x22;&#x3E;accusing a Daily Beast reporter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; who asked him whether he was gay of &#x22;using sexuality as a weapon&#x22; against him, emphasizing his &#x22;right to privacy.&#x22;)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kevin Spacey has long since invoked that &#x26;ldquo;right to privacy&#x26;rdquo; throughout his career to defer and evade discussions about his personal life and identity. There is nothing inherently wrong with that; Spacey is not a politician or pundit, and he has a right to perform his identity on whatever terms he&#x26;rsquo;s comfortable with. The academic critic Nicholas de Villiers has even coined the term &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/afterthoughts-on-queer-opacity/&#x22;&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;queer opacity&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to refer to public figures who are neither inside nor outside the closet, but rather tease the public through ambiguous statements that resist attempts to elicit confessions or pin down identities. In some ways this has been Spacey&#x26;rsquo;s modus operandi. And yet now that his personal behavior is being questioned, Spacey is finally willing to turn the personal political, unambiguously stepping out as a &#x26;ldquo;gay man.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Spacey&#x26;rsquo;s coming-out is a complicated reminder of the way that those closest to institutional power and privilege &#x26;mdash; whether in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, or politics &#x26;mdash; have the luxury of choosing when to make gay identity political. And the choice is often not to use it in service of social change, but to protect personal or commercial interests. Rapp&#x26;rsquo;s account has started a difficult conversation, given that accusing gay men of sexual misconduct can be weaponized by anti-LGBT groups to &#x26;ldquo;prove&#x26;rdquo; that all queer people are deviants. But it&#x26;rsquo;s important to remember that the accusers in these cases are often queer people too: Rapp &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/out100-2010/2010/11/07/where-are-they-now-anthony-rapp&#x22;&#x3E;came out&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in 1992, at a time when being openly gay as an actor could carry serious professional consequences. And the LGBT community at large still faces &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-assault-and-the-lgbt-community&#x22;&#x3E;high rates&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of sexual harassment and assault. So this is a conversation worth having &#x26;mdash; and the backlash against Spacey within the LGBT community suggests it&#x26;rsquo;s only getting started. &#x26;#x25CF;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>Trump&#x2019;s Anti-Islam Rhetoric Convinced These Muslims They Should Run For Office</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/talalansari/trumps-anti-islam-rhetoric-convinced-these-muslims-they?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>
<description><![CDATA[











 <p><b>If the unspoken</b> goal behind the Trump administration&rsquo;s anti-Muslim actions is to intimidate Muslims out of public life, it&rsquo;s backfiring.</p><p>The hostility instead appears to be sharpening Muslims&rsquo; political skills, energizing dozens of first-time candidates running for office &mdash; from school boards to Congress. At least two new Muslim-focused political action committees have sprung up, and several nonprofit groups are teaching potential candidates how to raise money, give effective speeches, and counter anti-Muslim smears.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no central count of how many Muslims are running for office nationwide, but Muslim political and advocacy groups have tallied dozens of names, describing the surge as unprecedented. In Maryland alone, around 30 Muslims are vying for state and local seats, a huge leap from the three who ran in 2014, according to the Pluralism Project, a political action committee that formed this year to boost Muslim candidates. Only a handful of Muslims hold public office across the country, including two in Congress: Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Rep. Andr&eacute; Carson of Indiana, both Democrats.</p>











 <p>"In the next election, one cycle from now, we&rsquo;re going to have candidates who have gone through the experience and they <i>will</i> slam dunk it.&rdquo;</p>






<p>Hamza Khan, director of the Pluralism Project and a Democratic candidate for state delegate in Maryland, said the ugly rhetoric about Islam from President Donald Trump and his associates fueled Muslims&rsquo; interest in politics, but it&rsquo;s not the only factor behind the increase. Demographic shifts in the electorate and among party gatekeepers also helped. And, Khan said, there&rsquo;s simply a bigger pool of viable Muslim candidates now: US-born or US-raised men and women who&rsquo;ve graduated from top colleges and emerged as leaders in their careers and communities.</p><p>The momentum is exciting to watch, Khan said, but the payoff may be a long time coming.</p><p>&ldquo;The chances of these folks winning their elections is still one in three or one in five," Khan said, adding that he doubted any Muslim could "slam dunk" a race this year. &ldquo;But in the next election, one cycle from now, we&rsquo;re going to have candidates who have gone through the experience and they <i>will</i> slam dunk it.&rdquo;</p><p>In interviews with BuzzFeed News, seven Muslim candidates discussed the symbolism of their runs as well as the extra pressures &mdash; and even dangers &mdash; from anti-Muslim forces determined to keep them out of office.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Muslims face death threats and hecklers interrupting stump speeches with tirades about Sharia. Candidates said they&rsquo;d like to dive right into issues such as minimum wage or health care, but first must answer questions to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; their Americanness and loyalty. Political opponents have smeared them as Muslim Brotherhood operatives, darkened their skin in photographs, and gratuitously mentioned their faith in speeches, Muslim candidates said.</p>

<p>Abdul El-Sayed, a Muslim doctor running for governor of Michigan as a Democrat, has hired a bodyguard and keeps the location of his campaign headquarters secret out of safety concerns. Others complain of feeling hamstrung because they need to reach voters but worry about publicizing their events too widely. A large campaign sign for Zainab Baloch, a Muslim who ran for city council in Raleigh, North Carolina, was defaced with ethnic slurs, a swastika, and &ldquo;Trump,&rdquo; just days before the election this month.</p><p>The extra burdens make for exhausting, stressful days, candidates said, but they knew going in that their religion would be much more closely scrutinized than their platforms.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s anxiety-provoking. The hate speech and the constant trolling,&rdquo; El-Sayed said, saying he&rsquo;d much prefer detailing his plans for the water crisis in Flint.</p>

<p>A video El-Sayed&rsquo;s campaign released this month depicts scenes Americans rarely see: an affectionate, ordinary Muslim family. El-Sayed and his pregnant wife, Sarah Jukaku, are shown decorating their nursery, embracing, and cooking together.<br /></p><p>On rough days, El-Sayed said, he thinks of the daughter he and his wife are expecting in the next few weeks. Their first child will be &ldquo;ethnically half-Egyptian, half-Indian, 100% American, Muslim,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;If I can do this to make it more normal for people like her to do whatever she chooses to do, in whatever realm she chooses, it&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;</p><p>Here are a few other candidates discussing the role Islam plays as they enter politics:</p>

<p><b>Liliana Bakhtiari isn&rsquo;t</b> eager to put her identity front and center as she runs for Atlanta City Council, but these days there isn&rsquo;t much of a choice.<br /><br />&ldquo;After Trump&rsquo;s first travel ban, five members of my family who are green card holders from Iran felt the threat of deportation,&rdquo; Bakhtiari said. &ldquo;It was a really terrifying time period where there was nothing I could do to assure my family that they were going to be OK.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakhtiari grew up working in her father&rsquo;s pharmacy in the historic and predominantly African-American Sweet Auburn district of Atlanta. It was there that she credits her father, a practicing Muslim, for instilling in her the importance of community service.</p><p>And since those formative days at the pharmacy, Bakhtiari, 29, has spent most of her life working in the nonprofit world. But it wasn&rsquo;t until recently that it dawned on her that despite all the work she was doing, like addressing child poverty and refugee resettlement in Atlanta, Bakhtiari was just treating what she called the &ldquo;symptom of other issues.&rdquo;</p><p>At the core of all these issues, Bakhtiari said, was bad or nonexistent legislation.</p><p>&ldquo;I chose to run because of housing issues, I chose to run because of affordability issues, and I feel local government can be far more progressive. And you don&rsquo;t need to be a queer Muslim to do that,&rdquo; Bakhtiari said. &ldquo;It just so happens that these things are part of my identity.&rdquo;</p><p>Growing up, Bakhtiari said, she was conditioned to stay small, to think small. &ldquo;And I&#39;m tired of being small,&rdquo; she said. So she decided to run for a seat on the city council.</p><p>Since launching her campaign, Bakhtiari said, she&rsquo;s received calls from young people and queer Muslims, telling her how important the race is because of who she is and what she looks like. That seeing a candidate like her gives them hope, a sense of familiarity. That&rsquo;s what will propel her to run again if she doesn&rsquo;t win a seat this year, she said.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a little girl, and her mom called me the other day and said that her daughter saw my picture and said, &lsquo;Mom she looks like me,&rsquo; and I think that&#39;s really important to see,&rdquo; Bakhtiari said.</p>

<p><b>&ldquo;Johnny Martin&rdquo; might</b> not jump out as a Muslim name to Arizona voters who will see it on a ballot come November. But Martin is indeed Muslim, and his run for a state House seat is forcing the 24-year-old convert to talk about his faith more than he&rsquo;d like to on the campaign trail.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think it&#39;s coming up because of the fact that the current administration is clearly using Islamophobia to move its agenda forward, and it&#39;s that agenda itself that is the reason I&rsquo;m running,&rdquo; Martin said.</p>











 <p>"The current administration is clearly using Islamophobia to move its agenda forward, and it&#39;s that agenda itself that is the reason I&rsquo;m running.&rdquo;</p>






<p>Martin, a Democrat, hopes to work on issues including raising teacher salaries in the state and banning the use of private prisons, but he says his position as a convert, a white male in particular, gives him a unique opportunity to combat anti-Muslim sentiment or misinformation when it comes his way.</p><p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m a Muslim when they first meet me, and that often puts me in situations that other Muslims or people of color aren&rsquo;t necessarily in, and I get to hear the type of things I&rsquo;m hearing,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>And his religion is not the only part of his identity under attack from the Trump administration. Martin came out as queer when he was speaking at an interfaith event after the Orlando nightclub shootings.</p><p>Martin, who has long been involved in local activism, said the reason he got into politics was because he sees it as the place where tangible change can happen &mdash; and it&rsquo;s where activists like him may need to start focusing more of their attention.</p><p>"In the time during the Obama administration, activism was where change was happening, and not necessarily in government,&rdquo; Martin explained. &ldquo;But now the government has become so dangerous, I really felt that it was important to run for office.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>It was more</b> &ldquo;when,&rdquo; not &ldquo;if.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>That is how Zainab Baloch describes how she felt when she heard that an ethnic slur and a swastika were graffitied onto her campaign sign this month, just four days before the election. The words &ldquo;sand nigger,&rdquo; a hastily sprayed swastika, and &ldquo;Trump,&rdquo; were tagged in black paint across a sign touting her run for city council in her hometown of Raleigh, North Carolina.</p><p>&ldquo;You have an understanding that when you live in the South, there are many people that do think this way,&rdquo; Baloch said of the offensive words, something she had already experienced regularly on social media since the campaign began. &ldquo;We were prepared for it, but when it actually happens, I have to say, it sucks.&rdquo;</p><p>But after the incident something unexpected happened. Baloch, a 26-year-old who works for the North Carolina Division of Mental Health, said the city in which she was born and raised rallied behind her. People came out to support her &mdash; even rival candidates. &ldquo;Absolutely reprehensible,&rdquo; was how Raleigh&rsquo;s mayor, Nancy McFarlane, described the incident.</p>











 <p>&ldquo;If 2016 didn&#39;t happen, I probably wouldn&#39;t be running for city council.&rdquo;</p>






<p>Baloch said her team was galvanized by the hateful message. It propelled them to work harder on outreach just days before the election.</p><p>Baloch, who ran on a platform of affordable housing and increasing the minimum wage, said the word &ldquo;Trump&rdquo; scrawled on her sign was a reminder of why she ran in the first place.</p><p>&ldquo;If 2016 didn&#39;t happen, I probably wouldn&#39;t be running for city council,&rdquo; Baloch said. &ldquo;If we can thank our president for one thing, it&rsquo;s for motivating a lot of people to run who probably wouldn&#39;t have had otherwise.&rdquo;</p><p>Although Baloch lost the Oct. 10 election, getting 11% of the vote, she plans on running again.</p><p>&ldquo;That was a question everybody would ask me before the campaign and I would say I have no idea. But there has still never been a woman of color on the Raleigh City Council. And we still don&rsquo;t have young people on the council,&rdquo; Baloch said. &ldquo;And that doesn&#39;t seem like it will change in two years, so yeah, I do want to run again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Fayrouz Saad, a Democrat who&rsquo;s</b> running for Congress from Michigan, is often asked whether her Arabic name is a liability with voters. If it is, she&rsquo;s decided to own it. Her kickoff video begins with a tongue-in-cheek look at the many misspellings of her name on Starbucks coffee cups: Farusc, Farus, Faraus.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t staged &mdash; they were real,&rdquo; Saad said on a recent visit to Washington. &ldquo;This is how you get there. You can&rsquo;t try to hide it &mdash; this is how you&rsquo;re going to make a change, dispel myths, and break down stereotypes.&rdquo;</p>











 <p>"This is how you&rsquo;re going to make a change, dispel myths, and break down stereotypes.&rdquo;</p>






<p>To Saad, &ldquo;getting there&rdquo; means having a seat in government, both to safeguard values she believes are under threat and to represent women, Muslims, immigrants, and other groups that feel vulnerable under the Trump administration. The openly anti-immigrant tenor of today&rsquo;s politics, she said, is strikingly different from the America her parents encountered when they moved to Michigan from Lebanon more than 40 years ago.</p><p>The family opened a halal meat company near Detroit. Saad, age 34, and her five siblings went to public school and rose as community leaders. Saad is a former Obama administration appointee whose win would make her the first Muslim woman in Congress; she&rsquo;s also served as director of Detroit&rsquo;s Office of Immigrant Affairs. She trades campaign advice with one of her sisters, Mariam Bazzi, who was appointed to a county judgeship earlier this year and must run in 2018 to keep the seat.</p><p>Saad cringes at the clich&eacute;, but it&rsquo;s true: Her family&rsquo;s story is the American Dream. And the Trump administration&rsquo;s efforts to restrict access to that dream, she said, is why she decided this was the year to pursue her goal of running for office.</p><p>&ldquo;Seeing everything I was seeing at the national level, that was the push,&rdquo; Saad said. &ldquo;Now more than ever, change is needed. Now more than ever is the time to have a seat at the table.&rdquo;</p><p>Saad announced her candidacy in July. Within 24 hours, she said, trolls on social media poked at her religion and Arab roots. They left out parts of her bio &mdash; it didn&rsquo;t suit their framing that Saad spent her time at Homeland Security working on community policing efforts to fight terrorism.</p><p>In the long weeks of campaigning ahead, Saad said, she&rsquo;ll try to focus on the issues and not the identity questions, though she knows it could get ugly. Her race is sure to be closely watched: Republican incumbent Rep. Dave Trott said he wasn&rsquo;t seeking reelection, leaving the seat up for grabs in a Republican-leaning district the Democrats are hoping to flip. First up is a contested Democratic primary next August.</p><p>&ldquo;You just hope that by continuing to run a professional campaign and to speak to your core message, you can show people, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m American like everyone else and we believe in the same values,&rsquo;&rdquo; Saad said.</p>

<p><b>Not long after</b> Regina Mustafa, a Democrat, announced she was running for Congress from Minnesota, a man claiming to be a reporter called her for an interview. After a few introductory remarks, Mustafa recalled, he began asking invasive questions about her conversion to Islam, and it became clear the call was a setup. He then screamed at her and refused to give his name.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He got me good,&rdquo; Mustafa said with a wry laugh.</p>











 <p>"There are people who just want to shake me out of the race, but this is exactly why I need to be in the race.&rdquo;</p>






<p>But then came a more sinister backlash to her candidacy. Mustafa opened her home mailbox and found a five-page screed about Islam from a stranger who demanded that she publicly denounce specific verses of the Qur&rsquo;an. The same day, Mustafa learned that someone had left a death threat in the comments section of a video about her on YouTube. &ldquo;She will be shot,&rdquo; it read, along with vulgar, sexist slurs. Mustafa alerted a Muslim advocacy group and the police.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so used to getting anti-Muslim comments over the years, but this was the first clear-cut threat and also the nastiest,&rdquo; Mustafa said. &ldquo;But about 75% of me thought, <i>Well, you knew this was going to happen and you&rsquo;ve got to deal with it</i>. There are people who just want to shake me out of the race, but this is exactly why I need to be in the race.&rdquo;</p><p>Two weeks after those defiant words, however, Mustafa withdrew from the race, citing not hostility but lackluster fundraising. In a phone interview, she sounded dejected, but not defeated, vowing to run for office again. Next time, she said, she might aim for a local seat such as mayor or city council.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret a second,&rdquo; Mustafa said. &ldquo;I was able to go to various parts of the state I&rsquo;d never been to. For many people, I was the first Muslim they&rsquo;d ever really spoken to or had a conversation with. If I&rsquo;ve humanized Islam more by my presence out in the district, it was all worth it.&rdquo; &#x25CF;</p>

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;If the unspoken&#x3C;/b&#x3E; goal behind the Trump administration&#x26;rsquo;s anti-Muslim actions is to intimidate Muslims out of public life, it&#x26;rsquo;s backfiring.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The hostility instead appears to be sharpening Muslims&#x26;rsquo; political skills, energizing dozens of first-time candidates running for office &#x26;mdash; from school boards to Congress. At least two new Muslim-focused political action committees have sprung up, and several nonprofit groups are teaching potential candidates how to raise money, give effective speeches, and counter anti-Muslim smears.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;There&#x26;rsquo;s no central count of how many Muslims are running for office nationwide, but Muslim political and advocacy groups have tallied dozens of names, describing the surge as unprecedented. In Maryland alone, around 30 Muslims are vying for state and local seats, a huge leap from the three who ran in 2014, according to the Pluralism Project, a political action committee that formed this year to boost Muslim candidates. Only a handful of Muslims hold public office across the country, including two in Congress: Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Rep. Andr&#x26;eacute; Carson of Indiana, both Democrats.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;In the next election, one cycle from now, we&#x26;rsquo;re going to have candidates who have gone through the experience and they &#x3C;i&#x3E;will&#x3C;/i&#x3E; slam dunk it.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hamza Khan, director of the Pluralism Project and a Democratic candidate for state delegate in Maryland, said the ugly rhetoric about Islam from President Donald Trump and his associates fueled Muslims&#x26;rsquo; interest in politics, but it&#x26;rsquo;s not the only factor behind the increase. Demographic shifts in the electorate and among party gatekeepers also helped. And, Khan said, there&#x26;rsquo;s simply a bigger pool of viable Muslim candidates now: US-born or US-raised men and women who&#x26;rsquo;ve graduated from top colleges and emerged as leaders in their careers and communities.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The momentum is exciting to watch, Khan said, but the payoff may be a long time coming.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;The chances of these folks winning their elections is still one in three or one in five,&#x22; Khan said, adding that he doubted any Muslim could &#x22;slam dunk&#x22; a race this year. &#x26;ldquo;But in the next election, one cycle from now, we&#x26;rsquo;re going to have candidates who have gone through the experience and they &#x3C;i&#x3E;will&#x3C;/i&#x3E; slam dunk it.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In interviews with BuzzFeed News, seven Muslim candidates discussed the symbolism of their runs as well as the extra pressures &#x26;mdash; and even dangers &#x26;mdash; from anti-Muslim forces determined to keep them out of office.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the campaign trail, Muslims face death threats and hecklers interrupting stump speeches with tirades about Sharia. Candidates said they&#x26;rsquo;d like to dive right into issues such as minimum wage or health care, but first must answer questions to &#x26;ldquo;prove&#x26;rdquo; their Americanness and loyalty. Political opponents have smeared them as Muslim Brotherhood operatives, darkened their skin in photographs, and gratuitously mentioned their faith in speeches, Muslim candidates said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abdul El-Sayed, a Muslim doctor running for governor of Michigan as a Democrat, has hired a bodyguard and keeps the location of his campaign headquarters secret out of safety concerns. Others complain of feeling hamstrung because they need to reach voters but worry about publicizing their events too widely. A large campaign sign for Zainab Baloch, a Muslim who ran for city council in Raleigh, North Carolina, was defaced with ethnic slurs, a swastika, and &#x26;ldquo;Trump,&#x26;rdquo; just days before the election this month.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The extra burdens make for exhausting, stressful days, candidates said, but they knew going in that their religion would be much more closely scrutinized than their platforms.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;rsquo;s anxiety-provoking. The hate speech and the constant trolling,&#x26;rdquo; El-Sayed said, saying he&#x26;rsquo;d much prefer detailing his plans for the water crisis in Flint.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;A video El-Sayed&#x26;rsquo;s campaign released this month depicts scenes Americans rarely see: an affectionate, ordinary Muslim family. El-Sayed and his pregnant wife, Sarah Jukaku, are shown decorating their nursery, embracing, and cooking together.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On rough days, El-Sayed said, he thinks of the daughter he and his wife are expecting in the next few weeks. Their first child will be &#x26;ldquo;ethnically half-Egyptian, half-Indian, 100% American, Muslim,&#x26;rdquo; he said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;If I can do this to make it more normal for people like her to do whatever she chooses to do, in whatever realm she chooses, it&#x26;rsquo;s worth it.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Here are a few other candidates discussing the role Islam plays as they enter politics:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Martin, a Democrat, hopes to work on issues including raising teacher salaries in the state and banning the use of private prisons, but he says his position as a convert, a white male in particular, gives him a unique opportunity to combat anti-Muslim sentiment or misinformation when it comes his way.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;People don&#x26;rsquo;t know that I&#x26;rsquo;m a Muslim when they first meet me, and that often puts me in situations that other Muslims or people of color aren&#x26;rsquo;t necessarily in, and I get to hear the type of things I&#x26;rsquo;m hearing,&#x26;rdquo; he said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;And his religion is not the only part of his identity under attack from the Trump administration. Martin came out as queer when he was speaking at an interfaith event after the Orlando nightclub shootings.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Martin, who has long been involved in local activism, said the reason he got into politics was because he sees it as the place where tangible change can happen &#x26;mdash; and it&#x26;rsquo;s where activists like him may need to start focusing more of their attention.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;In the time during the Obama administration, activism was where change was happening, and not necessarily in government,&#x26;rdquo; Martin explained. &#x26;ldquo;But now the government has become so dangerous, I really felt that it was important to run for office.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;It was more&#x3C;/b&#x3E; &#x26;ldquo;when,&#x26;rdquo; not &#x26;ldquo;if.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;That is how Zainab Baloch describes how she felt when she heard that an ethnic slur and a swastika were graffitied onto her campaign sign this month, just four days before the election. The words &#x26;ldquo;sand nigger,&#x26;rdquo; a hastily sprayed swastika, and &#x26;ldquo;Trump,&#x26;rdquo; were tagged in black paint across a sign touting her run for city council in her hometown of Raleigh, North Carolina.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You have an understanding that when you live in the South, there are many people that do think this way,&#x26;rdquo; Baloch said of the offensive words, something she had already experienced regularly on social media since the campaign began. &#x26;ldquo;We were prepared for it, but when it actually happens, I have to say, it sucks.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But after the incident something unexpected happened. Baloch, a 26-year-old who works for the North Carolina Division of Mental Health, said the city in which she was born and raised rallied behind her. People came out to support her &#x26;mdash; even rival candidates. &#x26;ldquo;Absolutely reprehensible,&#x26;rdquo; was how Raleigh&#x26;rsquo;s mayor, Nancy McFarlane, described the incident.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;If 2016 didn&#x26;#39;t happen, I probably wouldn&#x26;#39;t be running for city council.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;Baloch said her team was galvanized by the hateful message. It propelled them to work harder on outreach just days before the election.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Baloch, who ran on a platform of affordable housing and increasing the minimum wage, said the word &#x26;ldquo;Trump&#x26;rdquo; scrawled on her sign was a reminder of why she ran in the first place.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;If 2016 didn&#x26;#39;t happen, I probably wouldn&#x26;#39;t be running for city council,&#x26;rdquo; Baloch said. &#x26;ldquo;If we can thank our president for one thing, it&#x26;rsquo;s for motivating a lot of people to run who probably wouldn&#x26;#39;t have had otherwise.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Although Baloch lost the Oct. 10 election, getting 11% of the vote, she plans on running again.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;That was a question everybody would ask me before the campaign and I would say I have no idea. But there has still never been a woman of color on the Raleigh City Council. And we still don&#x26;rsquo;t have young people on the council,&#x26;rdquo; Baloch said. &#x26;ldquo;And that doesn&#x26;#39;t seem like it will change in two years, so yeah, I do want to run again.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Fayrouz Saad&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Fayrouz Saad, a Democrat who&#x26;rsquo;s&#x3C;/b&#x3E; running for Congress from Michigan, is often asked whether her Arabic name is a liability with voters. If it is, she&#x26;rsquo;s decided to own it. Her kickoff video begins with a tongue-in-cheek look at the many misspellings of her name on Starbucks coffee cups: Farusc, Farus, Faraus.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;They weren&#x26;rsquo;t staged &#x26;mdash; they were real,&#x26;rdquo; Saad said on a recent visit to Washington. &#x26;ldquo;This is how you get there. You can&#x26;rsquo;t try to hide it &#x26;mdash; this is how you&#x26;rsquo;re going to make a change, dispel myths, and break down stereotypes.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;This is how you&#x26;rsquo;re going to make a change, dispel myths, and break down stereotypes.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;To Saad, &#x26;ldquo;getting there&#x26;rdquo; means having a seat in government, both to safeguard values she believes are under threat and to represent women, Muslims, immigrants, and other groups that feel vulnerable under the Trump administration. The openly anti-immigrant tenor of today&#x26;rsquo;s politics, she said, is strikingly different from the America her parents encountered when they moved to Michigan from Lebanon more than 40 years ago.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The family opened a halal meat company near Detroit. Saad, age 34, and her five siblings went to public school and rose as community leaders. Saad is a former Obama administration appointee whose win would make her the first Muslim woman in Congress; she&#x26;rsquo;s also served as director of Detroit&#x26;rsquo;s Office of Immigrant Affairs. She trades campaign advice with one of her sisters, Mariam Bazzi, who was appointed to a county judgeship earlier this year and must run in 2018 to keep the seat.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Saad cringes at the clich&#x26;eacute;, but it&#x26;rsquo;s true: Her family&#x26;rsquo;s story is the American Dream. And the Trump administration&#x26;rsquo;s efforts to restrict access to that dream, she said, is why she decided this was the year to pursue her goal of running for office.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Seeing everything I was seeing at the national level, that was the push,&#x26;rdquo; Saad said. &#x26;ldquo;Now more than ever, change is needed. Now more than ever is the time to have a seat at the table.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Saad announced her candidacy in July. Within 24 hours, she said, trolls on social media poked at her religion and Arab roots. They left out parts of her bio &#x26;mdash; it didn&#x26;rsquo;t suit their framing that Saad spent her time at Homeland Security working on community policing efforts to fight terrorism.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the long weeks of campaigning ahead, Saad said, she&#x26;rsquo;ll try to focus on the issues and not the identity questions, though she knows it could get ugly. Her race is sure to be closely watched: Republican incumbent Rep. Dave Trott said he wasn&#x26;rsquo;t seeking reelection, leaving the seat up for grabs in a Republican-leaning district the Democrats are hoping to flip. First up is a contested Democratic primary next August.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You just hope that by continuing to run a professional campaign and to speak to your core message, you can show people, &#x26;lsquo;I&#x26;rsquo;m American like everyone else and we believe in the same values,&#x26;rsquo;&#x26;rdquo; Saad said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Regina Mustafa&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;BuzzFeed News; Mustafa Campaign; Getty Images&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Not long after&#x3C;/b&#x3E; Regina Mustafa, a Democrat, announced she was running for Congress from Minnesota, a man claiming to be a reporter called her for an interview. After a few introductory remarks, Mustafa recalled, he began asking invasive questions about her conversion to Islam, and it became clear the call was a setup. He then screamed at her and refused to give his name.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;He got me good,&#x26;rdquo; Mustafa said with a wry laugh.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;There are people who just want to shake me out of the race, but this is exactly why I need to be in the race.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;But then came a more sinister backlash to her candidacy. Mustafa opened her home mailbox and found a five-page screed about Islam from a stranger who demanded that she publicly denounce specific verses of the Qur&#x26;rsquo;an. The same day, Mustafa learned that someone had left a death threat in the comments section of a video about her on YouTube. &#x26;ldquo;She will be shot,&#x26;rdquo; it read, along with vulgar, sexist slurs. Mustafa alerted a Muslim advocacy group and the police.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;ve been so used to getting anti-Muslim comments over the years, but this was the first clear-cut threat and also the nastiest,&#x26;rdquo; Mustafa said. &#x26;ldquo;But about 75% of me thought, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Well, you knew this was going to happen and you&#x26;rsquo;ve got to deal with it&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. There are people who just want to shake me out of the race, but this is exactly why I need to be in the race.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks after those defiant words, however, Mustafa withdrew from the race, citing not hostility but lackluster fundraising. In a phone interview, she sounded dejected, but not defeated, vowing to run for office again. Next time, she said, she might aim for a local seat such as mayor or city council.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I don&#x26;rsquo;t regret a second,&#x26;rdquo; Mustafa said. &#x26;ldquo;I was able to go to various parts of the state I&#x26;rsquo;d never been to. For many people, I was the first Muslim they&#x26;rsquo;d ever really spoken to or had a conversation with. If I&#x26;rsquo;ve humanized Islam more by my presence out in the district, it was all worth it.&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;#x25CF;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p>Who knew the Dutch were responsible for the prevalence of orange carrots?</p>












 

 
	<h1>In <i>The Secret Lives of Color</i>, Kassia St. Clair asks readers to look at color in a new way: through history.</h1>

	<p>Organized into 75 shades, St. Clair&#39;s book delves into the origin stories, trivia items, cultural connotations, and little-known facts behind specific colors &mdash; from the pink that became synonymous with punk to the brown that changed military strategy &mdash; which, all together, make up a collection that&#39;s surprisingly hard to put down. Below are some of our favorites.</p>

	<p>In 1979, after a decade during which US cities experienced spikes in drug use and violence, Professor Alexander Schauss announced he found a cure for aggressiveness: the color pink. Schauss based this theory on a year of experiments which showed that young men who stared at the color pink for a minute were demonstrably weaker than men who spent a minute staring at deep blue. </p>

<p>When two commanding officers at the US Naval Correctional Center in Seattle decided to paint one of their holding cells Schauss&#39;s pink &mdash; but only after adding some semigloss red to get, according to St. Clair, "the perfect Pepto-Bismol shade" &mdash; the violence that had been plaguing their institution stopped for a full 156 days. Baker and Miller went on a media tour to talk about their discovery, but their finding was the subject of controversy in the academic world. Today, Baker-Miller pink is pretty rare.</p>

	<p>Believe it or not, there is actually a woman credited as the first person to be called a "dumb blonde." Her name was Rosalie Duth&eacute;, she was "famously beautiful," and she was born in 18th-century France. Because of her precocious beauty, her parents sent her to a convent as a young girl to keep her away from leering men, but she ended up leaving to be with a rich British financier. After running his wallet dry, Duth&eacute; became a dancer, courtesan, nude model, and general woman of interest &mdash; though this lifestyle came with a reputation of stupidity. </p>

<p>Her reputation was so well known that she found herself satirized in a 1775 one-act play in Paris, <i>Les Curiosit&eacute;s de la Foire.</i> Duth&eacute; was apparently mortified, though tbh she shouldn&#39;t have been &mdash; get that money, girl.</p>

	<p>Though what was once the principality of Orange is now part of the southern France, the House of Orange &mdash; and specifically William I, Prince of Orange &mdash; was fundamental to the birth of the Netherlands. The Dutch loyalty to William I (the descendants of whom still make up the Dutch royal family) was so strong that the color orange became a key marker of their national brand.</p>

<p>This meant portraits showed members of the family wrapped in orange clothes. An early version of the Dutch flag was blue, white, and orange, until they came to terms with the fact that they couldn&#39;t find an orange dye that wouldn&#39;t run. (Today, it is blue, white, and red.) Most interesting, though, is the effect on carrots. According to St. Clair: "Originally a tough and rather bitter tuber from South America, prior to the seventeenth century [the carrot] was usually purple or yellow.

	<p>People have been describing shades of blue as "electric" since the late 19th century, right as Thomas Edison was working to use electricity to produce light. In an 1874 issue of a British drapers&#39; trade publication, one velvet piece was described as "dark electric blue," ditto a "walking dress" in an 1883 issue of Young Ladies&#39; Journal.</p>

<p>The connection consistently signaled modernity &mdash; and it still does. See: the electric blue light transmitted from futuristic technology in <i><a href="https://www.theawl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/0GIEkFelizCz1ovZQ.jpg">Minority Report</a></i> and both <i><a href="http://jonvilma.com/images/tron-legacy-1.jpg">Tron</a></i> films, the <a href="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-movie-poster-7.jpg">electric blue-tinted stills</a> from <i>Inception</i>, and, of course, <a href="https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/gallery_walle__0003_04_a6dc7f64.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1580%2C880"><i>Wall-E</i>.</a></p>

	<p>Emeralds are relatively rare, fragile, and valuable gemstones usually sourced in Pakistan, India, Zambia, and parts of South America. One specific emerald called the Bahia, though, has been the source of recent controversy. Mined from Brazil in 2001, the Bahia weighs in at a gargantuan 840 pounds ("roughly the same as a male polar bear," St. Clair writes) and is estimated to contain 180,000 carats. </p>

<p>Since its discovery, the stone has been at the center of multiple frauds. At one point it was listed on eBay for a buy-it-now price of $75 million; today, it&#39;s the subject of a major California lawsuit in which a dozen people claim to have purchased it fair and square. In the meantime, Brazil is fighting for its return. It&#39;s no wonder the Bahia is so popular: It&#39;s currently valued at $400 million.</p>

	<p>Obsidian, also known as volcanic glass, has long been used in mystical and occult circles. One specific piece &mdash; a thick, glossy disk with a small handle, currently at the British Museum in London &mdash; has been tracked since it was first created by the Aztecs, in honor of their god Tezcatlipoca (or, "smoking mirror"). The mirror was brought into Europe after Cort&eacute;s invaded what is now Mexico, and eventually made its way into the hands of an Elizabethan astrologer and philosopher named Dr. John Dee. </p>

<p>Dr. Dee was said to have used the mirror to "call his spirits," but such an activity wasn&#39;t the slightest bit unusual at the time. Dee was not only a believer in the occult, he was also the queen&#39;s adviser, and he received insight by "talking to angels" through the mirror and mediums. When Christianity became paranoid and obsessive about the devil and witchcraft in the late 16th century, though, all things black became associated with evil. That the mirror wasn&#39;t destroyed wasn&#39;t just good luck &mdash; on the advice of one of the angels Dee communed with, Dee burned all 28 volumes of his records of communication with mediums, and it&#39;s surprising any record of his mysticism exists at all.</p>

    <media:description type="html">Organized into 75 shades, St. Clair&#x27;s book delves into the origin stories, trivia items, cultural connotations, and little-known facts behind specific colors &#x2014; from the pink that became synonymous with punk to the brown that changed military strategy &#x2014;&#x26;nbsp;which, all together, make up a collection that&#x27;s surprisingly hard to put down.

    <media:description type="html">In 1979, after a decade during which US cities experienced spikes in drug use and violence, Professor Alexander Schauss announced he found a cure for aggressiveness: the color pink. Schauss based this theory on a year of experiments which showed that young men who stared at the color pink for a minute were demonstrably weaker than men who spent a minute staring at deep blue. 

When two commanding officers at the US Naval Correctional Center in Seattle decided to paint one of their holding cells Schauss&#x27;s pink &#x2014;&#x26;nbsp;but only after adding some semigloss red to get, according to St. Clair, &#x22;the perfect Pepto-Bismol shade&#x22; &#x2014;&#x26;nbsp;the violence that had been plaguing their institution stopped for a full 156 days. Baker and Miller went on a media tour to talk about their discovery, but their finding was the subject of controversy in the academic world. Today, Baker-Miller pink is pretty rare.</media:description>

    <media:description type="html">Believe it or not, there is actually a woman credited as the first person to be called a &#x22;dumb blonde.&#x22; Her name was Rosalie Duth&#xE9;, she was &#x22;famously beautiful,&#x22; and she was born in 18th-century France. Because of her precocious beauty, her parents sent her to a convent as a young girl to keep her away from leering men, but she ended up leaving to be with a rich British financier. After running his wallet dry, Duth&#xE9; became a dancer, courtesan, nude model, and general woman of interest &#x2014;&#x26;nbsp;though this lifestyle came with a reputation of stupidity. 

Her reputation was so well known that she found herself satirized in a 1775 one-act play in Paris, &#x3C;i&#x3E;Les Curiosit&#xE9;s de la Foire.&#x3C;/i&#x3E; Duth&#xE9; was apparently mortified, though tbh she shouldn&#x27;t have been &#x2014;&#x26;nbsp;get that money, girl.</media:description>

    <media:description type="html">Though what was once the principality of Orange is now part of the southern France, the House of Orange &#x2014; and specifically William I, Prince of Orange &#x2014;&#x26;nbsp;was fundamental to the birth of the Netherlands. The Dutch loyalty to William I (the descendants of whom still make up the Dutch royal family) was so strong that the color orange became a key marker of their national brand.

This meant portraits showed members of the family wrapped in orange clothes. An early version of the Dutch flag was blue, white, and orange, until they came to terms with the fact that they couldn&#x27;t find an orange dye that wouldn&#x27;t run. (Today, it is blue, white, and red.) Most interesting, though, is the effect on carrots. According to St. Clair: &#x22;Originally a tough and rather bitter tuber from South America, prior to the seventeenth century [the carrot] was usually purple or yellow. Over the next 100 years, however, Dutch farmers selectively bred carrots to produce orange varieties.&#x22;</media:description>

<title>Matt Damon&#x2019;s Limitations Are Catching Up With Him</title>

	<p>Matt Damon in Washington, DC, on April 20.</p>


 <p><small>Nicholas Kamm / AFP / Getty Images</small></p>




<p><b>Matt Damon is</b> a Hollywood A-lister who presents himself as just a regular guy. He&rsquo;s the star of the Jason Bourne action series, various high-budget thrillers, and a surprising number of films where he must be rescued from space. He regularly appears in Oscar season prestige movies directed by male directors that sound good on paper but fade by January.<br /></p><p>He is charming but never interesting. It takes directors like the Coen brothers or Steven Soderbergh to make his presence memorable. His notable qualities include being best friends with fellow A-list actor Ben Affleck, having blonde hair and a toothy smile, &ldquo;being from Boston,&rdquo; and using his capital and genuine smarts to give interviews in which he will discuss politics if given the opportunity.</p><p>Damon cares. He likes public school teachers. He&rsquo;s the founder of Water.org, an organization that advocates for clean drinking water in developing countries. His sonorous voice can be found narrating documentaries that detail such things as the 2008 financial crisis and our faulty educational system. He&rsquo;s the platonic ideal of a Hollywood liberal.</p><p>Yet in 2017, Damon&rsquo;s careful public image is showing signs of wear. It may be a case of a man who became a movie star in the last century adjusting badly to a world where the internet&rsquo;s real-time reaction machine can expose someone&rsquo;s intellectual failings and emptiness with one viral video. Hollywood has an outsize influence on the things that we talk about &mdash; if it weren&rsquo;t for Hollywood, our current president would not be in office.</p><p>Stars like Damon embody the default liberalism of Hollywood: prominent names with money who give to the right charities and who make brave speeches denouncing the state of political discourse today. But this form of liberalism is growing rapidly outdated as Hollywood&rsquo;s complicity around issues of sexual harassment and assault become clear. In interviews, Damon makes a point to espouse &ldquo;good politics,&rdquo; but his consistent patterns of gaffes and his films (notably lacking in female directors) reflect an incuriosity and indifference to the voices of consistently marginalized Hollywood members (women &mdash; especially women of color, LGBT actors, and sexual assault victims) who now have the power to speak up and to tell him he&rsquo;s wrong through public platforms.</p><p>As he embarks on a press tour for this month&rsquo;s <i>Suburbicon,</i> which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/movies/jigsaw-suburbicon-george-clooney.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F10%2F29%2Fmovies%2Fjigsaw-suburbicon-george-clooney.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click&amp;_r=0&amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=A13C734E78CC8F5BB17E2DA6F8C0A403&amp;gwt=pay">flopped</a> this weekend, and December&rsquo;s <i>Downsizing</i>, he may finally be forced to grapple with the ways in which his politics seem incomplete.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/1997/12/matt-damon-199712">Here</a> is 27-year-old Damon on the cover of Vanity Fair&rsquo;s December issue in 1997.

His mom thinks acting will screw him up. He really wants a career like Ed Harris. He is really obsessed with Chris O&rsquo;Donnell (which just plays cruel 20 years down the line, when Damon is on the A-list and O&rsquo;Donnell stars in <i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i>).

<p>It was a steady, word-of-mouth hit that made the careers of Damon and Affleck. It did well at the 1997 Oscars: Robin Williams won for Best Supporting Actor, and Damon and Affleck won for Best Original Screenplay. But <i>Good Will Hunting</i> wasn&rsquo;t just a good movie &mdash; it left a mark, eventually responsible for a lot of now-familiar pop culture tropes: the Boston movie featuring &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; working-class white folks committing crimes or being really sad, the touting of Howard Zinn&rsquo;s <i>A People&rsquo;s History of the United State</i>s as the go-to talisman for vaguely leftist politics (in 2000, Damon, Affleck, and Zinn made an appearance <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/5/6/affleck-damon-speak-at-living-wage/">at a living-wage rally</a> for Harvard employees), and the unstoppable influence of &ldquo;Matt and Ben,&rdquo; a modern-day power couple with an unimpeachable best-buds-since-childhood friendship.<br /><br />The two friends fell into neat slots, smart and pretty, especially if you conflated them with their <i>Good Will Hunting</i> characters. Out of the two, Damon was the smart one. The son of a college professor, he was a Harvard dropout who first thought of Will Hunting in a class and was so dedicated to the craft of acting that he lost 60 pounds to play a soldier in a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115956/">middling Meg Ryan film</a>; and since those early years Damon has managed to corral that good favor into innocuous press coverage.</p><p>According to Damon &mdash; and profiles of Damon over the years essentially corroborate this &mdash; he is boring.

He criticized Barack Obama <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/03/02/matt.damon.piers.morgan.tonight/index.html">for a variety of failures</a>, from with squandering his mandate to execute change (with a Democratic House and a Democratic-leaning Senate), to Obama&rsquo;s policy on drone strikes, and his failure to reform Wall Street.</p><p>Such outspokenness aligned him with a gauntlet of Hollywood liberal statesmen including George Clooney, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin. His positions were largely innocuous to most liberals, galling enough to grate conservatives and in short, cast him in a warm spotlight, where he could be the good guy, Josiah Bartlett in <i>The West Wing</i>, so to speak. See this 2011 video where he <a href="https://youtu.be/TJ7icVvDK9I">defends teacher tenure</a> (with his mother by his side), calling education policy &ldquo;intrinsically paternalistic,&rdquo; and in another video from that same rally he advocates for higher taxes saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s criminal that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyLafU0OEY0">so little is asked</a> of the wealthy. I don&rsquo;t mind paying more.&rdquo; Though Damon has proven to be politically outspoken in some ways, they contrast sharply with his repeated blind spots &mdash; which in the past two years have been made public in embarrassing fashion. (Is it obvious that Damon has no social media presence? It will be.)</p>

<p><b>In 2015, Damon</b> signed up for the reboot of HBO&rsquo;s <i>Project Greenlight</i>, the pioneering let&rsquo;s-make-a movie-reality-show that he participated in &mdash; along with Affleck &mdash; in the early 2000s. The show gives unknown up-and-comers the opportunity to make their own movie and it has yielded several films that have been forgotten to time. A decade on, the formula remains familiar: 13 aspiring directors (including three duos) pitch their take on an existing script to a team of Hollywood executives who are both judges and future coworkers (credited as producers), including Damon, Affleck, the Farrelly brothers (they directed <i>There&#39;s Something About Mary</i>), and producer Effie Brown (<i>Real Women Have Curves</i> and <i>Dear White People</i>). But the premiere episode of the reboot went viral for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>The directors had to weigh in on a <a href="http://flavorwire.com/537053/project-greenlight-season-4-premiere-recap">comedy script</a> in which a man is left at the altar and marries a sex worker named Harmony, a black woman whose white pimp beats her. Harmony is the only character of color in this comedy. One potential contender, a directing team (Kristen and Leo, a white woman and an Vietnamese man), showed some sensitivity toward the character.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/ehL7GVQ89mk">In the clip that went viral</a>, the judges discussed the potential directors. Brown expressed concern over how each contestant would treat the character of Harmony. She urged the group to consider diversity when picking the winning directors, obliquely referencing the pair of Kristen and Leo. Damon interrupted with a defensive monologue, dismissing Brown&rsquo;s point, and talking over her. He argued that &ldquo;when we&rsquo;re talking about diversity, you do it in the casting of the film, not in the casting of [<i>Project Greenlight</i>].&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hit with a fusillade of dismissal, Brown&rsquo;s reaction is telling: &ldquo;Oooh. Wow. Okay.&rdquo; As the discussion went on, she noted that the directing pair she was riding for stood out because they were sensitive to the character of Harmony, and Leo even credited his female partner with opening his mind. Instead of responding to her point about this duo, the <i>Project Greenlight</i> judges, a room full of Hollywood executives and professionals, then became defensive, saying &ldquo;Oh yes, I have a problem with Harmony too.&rdquo; The clip ends with Damon as a talking head saying he&rsquo;s glad that Brown flagged the issue of diversity, but you can&rsquo;t change the rules of the game &mdash; it&rsquo;s about the best filmmaker. He then talked earnestly about meritocracy.<br /></p><p>Twitter went off on Damon, coining the term #damonsplaining. The actor ended up apologizing with a <a href="http://variety.com/2015/film/news/matt-damon-project-greenlight-diversity-apology-1201595189/">statement</a> to Variety. He said that the scene was part of a broader discussion and shown out of context, and concluded with &ldquo;I am sorry that [my comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s disappointing about this apology is that it does not reckon with the source of the problem. Damon talked over his coworker, a black woman surely more attuned to the potential fallout of a stereotypical black female character in the script. His vague comments about diversity didn&rsquo;t really address the paucity of it in Hollywood. Not to mention the arrogance assumed in his presumption that he &ldquo;started&rdquo; a conversation about diversity in Hollywood. (<i>Project Greenlight</i> Season 4&rsquo;s final product, retitled <i>The Leisure Class</i>, has a zero rating on Rotten Tomatoes.)</p><p>Shortly on the heels of <i>Project Greenlight</i>, he had another gaffe, this time about LGBT people. In an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/27/matt-damon-i-think-you-are-a-better-actor-the-less-people-know-about-you">interview</a> with the Guardian, he ended a riff on out LGBT actors in Hollywood with this quote: &ldquo;In terms of actors, I think you&rsquo;re a better actor the less people know about you period. And sexuality is a huge part of that. Whether you&rsquo;re straight or gay, people shouldn&rsquo;t know anything about your sexuality because that&rsquo;s one of the mysteries that you should be able to play.&rdquo; Culture writers from <a href="http://uproxx.com/hitfix/7-ugly-implications-of-matt-damons-comments-about-out-gay-actors/#">Uproxx</a> and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/shut-up-matt-damon-the-actor-argues-gay-actors-should-stay-in-the-closet">the Daily Beast</a> laid into that statement&rsquo;s implications.</p><p>In the Daily Beast, Kevin Fallon noted that <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/shut-up-matt-damon-the-actor-argues-gay-actors-should-stay-in-the-closet">only a straight white man</a> who mentioned his civilian wife and four kids, a man who styles himself as the moral compass of the Hollywood establishment, could so blithely imply that sexuality could and should be hidden (for art&rsquo;s sake), unaware of the political importance of coming out publicly in Hollywood. Again, there was a clumsiness to Damon&rsquo;s quotes, and while he was attempting to shed light on how sexuality can affect the bottom line, he just sounded like someone who didn&rsquo;t understand the full weight of other people&rsquo;s experiences, even though he could easily blather on about it. Damon ended up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/29/matt-damon-gay-actors-the-martian-ellen-degeneres-show">apologizing on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i></a>, saying that he didn&rsquo;t intend to make anti-gay comments.</p><p>The gaffes would continue. In July 2016, a preview for Damon&rsquo;s film <i>The Great Wall</i> dropped. Wearing a man bun, Damon&#39;s awkward presence in the film, especially in the trailer, read like a white man who&#39;d come to save the Chinese. And it came on the heels of two big-budget films that featured straight-up Hollywood whitewashing: <i>Doctor Strange</i>, with Tilda Swinton in the role of an Asian character, and Scarlett Johansson in the then-upcoming anime adaptation <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>.</p>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Matt Damon is&#x3C;/b&#x3E; a Hollywood A-lister who presents himself as just a regular guy. He&#x26;rsquo;s the star of the Jason Bourne action series, various high-budget thrillers, and a surprising number of films where he must be rescued from space. He regularly appears in Oscar season prestige movies directed by male directors that sound good on paper but fade by January.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He is charming but never interesting. It takes directors like the Coen brothers or Steven Soderbergh to make his presence memorable. His notable qualities include being best friends with fellow A-list actor Ben Affleck, having blonde hair and a toothy smile, &#x26;ldquo;being from Boston,&#x26;rdquo; and using his capital and genuine smarts to give interviews in which he will discuss politics if given the opportunity.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Damon cares. He likes public school teachers. He&#x26;rsquo;s the founder of Water.org, an organization that advocates for clean drinking water in developing countries. His sonorous voice can be found narrating documentaries that detail such things as the 2008 financial crisis and our faulty educational system. He&#x26;rsquo;s the platonic ideal of a Hollywood liberal.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yet in 2017, Damon&#x26;rsquo;s careful public image is showing signs of wear. It may be a case of a man who became a movie star in the last century adjusting badly to a world where the internet&#x26;rsquo;s real-time reaction machine can expose someone&#x26;rsquo;s intellectual failings and emptiness with one viral video. Hollywood has an outsize influence on the things that we talk about &#x26;mdash; if it weren&#x26;rsquo;t for Hollywood, our current president would not be in office.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Stars like Damon embody the default liberalism of Hollywood: prominent names with money who give to the right charities and who make brave speeches denouncing the state of political discourse today. But this form of liberalism is growing rapidly outdated as Hollywood&#x26;rsquo;s complicity around issues of sexual harassment and assault become clear. In interviews, Damon makes a point to espouse &#x26;ldquo;good politics,&#x26;rdquo; but his consistent patterns of gaffes and his films (notably lacking in female directors) reflect an incuriosity and indifference to the voices of consistently marginalized Hollywood members (women &#x26;mdash; especially women of color, LGBT actors, and sexual assault victims) who now have the power to speak up and to tell him he&#x26;rsquo;s wrong through public platforms.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;As he embarks on a press tour for this month&#x26;rsquo;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Suburbicon,&#x3C;/i&#x3E; which &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/movies/jigsaw-suburbicon-george-clooney.html?module=WatchingPortal&#x26;amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&#x26;amp;pgType=Homepage&#x26;amp;action=click&#x26;amp;mediaId=thumb_square&#x26;amp;state=standard&#x26;amp;contentPlacement=1&#x26;amp;version=internal&#x26;amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&#x26;amp;contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F10%2F29%2Fmovies%2Fjigsaw-suburbicon-george-clooney.html&#x26;amp;eventName=Watching-article-click&#x26;amp;_r=0&#x26;amp;mtrref=undefined&#x26;amp;gwh=A13C734E78CC8F5BB17E2DA6F8C0A403&#x26;amp;gwt=pay&#x22;&#x3E;flopped&#x3C;/a&#x3E; this weekend, and December&#x26;rsquo;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Downsizing&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, he may finally be forced to grapple with the ways in which his politics seem incomplete.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

He is right on the verge of the A-list. He is Private Ryan in Steven Spielberg&#x26;rsquo;s next movie; he is starring in a Francis Ford Coppola adaptation of a John Grisham book; and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Good Will Hunting&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, a small independent movie that he wrote and starred in, is about to be released and will figure heavily into next year&#x26;rsquo;s Oscar race. He is going places, and Vanity Fair wants in on the action, introducing us to Damon as a regular guy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He&#x26;rsquo;s described as a &#x26;ldquo;nice knucklehead,&#x26;rdquo; in &#x26;ldquo;clothes that still look mother-bought,&#x26;rdquo; and he is mostly talking about the roles he lost to Chris O&#x26;rsquo;Donnell in &#x3C;i&#x3E;Scent of a Woman&#x3C;/i&#x3E; and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Batman and Robin&#x3C;/i&#x3E;.

His positions were largely innocuous to most liberals, galling enough to grate conservatives and in short, cast him in a warm spotlight, where he could be the good guy, Josiah Bartlett in &#x3C;i&#x3E;The West Wing&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, so to speak. See this 2011 video where he &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://youtu.be/TJ7icVvDK9I&#x22;&#x3E;defends teacher tenure&#x3C;/a&#x3E; (with his mother by his side), calling education policy &#x26;ldquo;intrinsically paternalistic,&#x26;rdquo; and in another video from that same rally he advocates for higher taxes saying &#x26;ldquo;it&#x26;rsquo;s criminal that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyLafU0OEY0&#x22;&#x3E;so little is asked&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the wealthy. I don&#x26;rsquo;t mind paying more.&#x26;rdquo; Though Damon has proven to be politically outspoken in some ways, they contrast sharply with his repeated blind spots &#x26;mdash; which in the past two years have been made public in embarrassing fashion. (Is it obvious that Damon has no social media presence? It will be.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;In 2015, Damon&#x3C;/b&#x3E; signed up for the reboot of HBO&#x26;rsquo;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Project Greenlight&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, the pioneering let&#x26;rsquo;s-make-a movie-reality-show that he participated in &#x26;mdash; along with Affleck &#x26;mdash; in the early 2000s. The show gives unknown up-and-comers the opportunity to make their own movie and it has yielded several films that have been forgotten to time. A decade on, the formula remains familiar: 13 aspiring directors (including three duos) pitch their take on an existing script to a team of Hollywood executives who are both judges and future coworkers (credited as producers), including Damon, Affleck, the Farrelly brothers (they directed &#x3C;i&#x3E;There&#x26;#39;s Something About Mary&#x3C;/i&#x3E;), and producer Effie Brown (&#x3C;i&#x3E;Real Women Have Curves&#x3C;/i&#x3E; and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Dear White People&#x3C;/i&#x3E;). But the premiere episode of the reboot went viral for all the wrong reasons.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The directors had to weigh in on a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://flavorwire.com/537053/project-greenlight-season-4-premiere-recap&#x22;&#x3E;comedy script&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in which a man is left at the altar and marries a sex worker named Harmony, a black woman whose white pimp beats her. Harmony is the only character of color in this comedy. One potential contender, a directing team (Kristen and Leo, a white woman and an Vietnamese man), showed some sensitivity toward the character.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://youtu.be/ehL7GVQ89mk&#x22;&#x3E;In the clip that went viral&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the judges discussed the potential directors. Brown expressed concern over how each contestant would treat the character of Harmony. She urged the group to consider diversity when picking the winning directors, obliquely referencing the pair of Kristen and Leo. Damon interrupted with a defensive monologue, dismissing Brown&#x26;rsquo;s point, and talking over her. He argued that &#x26;ldquo;when we&#x26;rsquo;re talking about diversity, you do it in the casting of the film, not in the casting of [&#x3C;i&#x3E;Project Greenlight&#x3C;/i&#x3E;].&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hit with a fusillade of dismissal, Brown&#x26;rsquo;s reaction is telling: &#x26;ldquo;Oooh. Wow. Okay.&#x26;rdquo; As the discussion went on, she noted that the directing pair she was riding for stood out because they were sensitive to the character of Harmony, and Leo even credited his female partner with opening his mind. Instead of responding to her point about this duo, the &#x3C;i&#x3E;Project Greenlight&#x3C;/i&#x3E; judges, a room full of Hollywood executives and professionals, then became defensive, saying &#x26;ldquo;Oh yes, I have a problem with Harmony too.&#x26;rdquo; The clip ends with Damon as a talking head saying he&#x26;rsquo;s glad that Brown flagged the issue of diversity, but you can&#x26;rsquo;t change the rules of the game &#x26;mdash; it&#x26;rsquo;s about the best filmmaker. He then talked earnestly about meritocracy.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Twitter went off on Damon, coining the term #damonsplaining. The actor ended up apologizing with a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://variety.com/2015/film/news/matt-damon-project-greenlight-diversity-apology-1201595189/&#x22;&#x3E;statement&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to Variety. He said that the scene was part of a broader discussion and shown out of context, and concluded with &#x26;ldquo;I am sorry that [my comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood.&#x26;rdquo; What&#x26;rsquo;s disappointing about this apology is that it does not reckon with the source of the problem. Damon talked over his coworker, a black woman surely more attuned to the potential fallout of a stereotypical black female character in the script. His vague comments about diversity didn&#x26;rsquo;t really address the paucity of it in Hollywood. Not to mention the arrogance assumed in his presumption that he &#x26;ldquo;started&#x26;rdquo; a conversation about diversity in Hollywood. (&#x3C;i&#x3E;Project Greenlight&#x3C;/i&#x3E; Season 4&#x26;rsquo;s final product, retitled &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Leisure Class&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, has a zero rating on Rotten Tomatoes.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Shortly on the heels of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Project Greenlight&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, he had another gaffe, this time about LGBT people. In an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/27/matt-damon-i-think-you-are-a-better-actor-the-less-people-know-about-you&#x22;&#x3E;interview&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with the Guardian, he ended a riff on out LGBT actors in Hollywood with this quote: &#x26;ldquo;In terms of actors, I think you&#x26;rsquo;re a better actor the less people know about you period. And sexuality is a huge part of that. Whether you&#x26;rsquo;re straight or gay, people shouldn&#x26;rsquo;t know anything about your sexuality because that&#x26;rsquo;s one of the mysteries that you should be able to play.&#x26;rdquo; Culture writers from &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://uproxx.com/hitfix/7-ugly-implications-of-matt-damons-comments-about-out-gay-actors/#&#x22;&#x3E;Uproxx&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.thedailybeast.com/shut-up-matt-damon-the-actor-argues-gay-actors-should-stay-in-the-closet&#x22;&#x3E;the Daily Beast&#x3C;/a&#x3E; laid into that statement&#x26;rsquo;s implications.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the Daily Beast, Kevin Fallon noted that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.thedailybeast.com/shut-up-matt-damon-the-actor-argues-gay-actors-should-stay-in-the-closet&#x22;&#x3E;only a straight white man&#x3C;/a&#x3E; who mentioned his civilian wife and four kids, a man who styles himself as the moral compass of the Hollywood establishment, could so blithely imply that sexuality could and should be hidden (for art&#x26;rsquo;s sake), unaware of the political importance of coming out publicly in Hollywood. Again, there was a clumsiness to Damon&#x26;rsquo;s quotes, and while he was attempting to shed light on how sexuality can affect the bottom line, he just sounded like someone who didn&#x26;rsquo;t understand the full weight of other people&#x26;rsquo;s experiences, even though he could easily blather on about it. Damon ended up &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/29/matt-damon-gay-actors-the-martian-ellen-degeneres-show&#x22;&#x3E;apologizing on &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, saying that he didn&#x26;rsquo;t intend to make anti-gay comments.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The gaffes would continue. In July 2016, a preview for Damon&#x26;rsquo;s film &#x3C;i&#x3E;The Great Wall&#x3C;/i&#x3E; dropped. Wearing a man bun, Damon&#x26;#39;s awkward presence in the film, especially in the trailer, read like a white man who&#x26;#39;d come to save the Chinese. And it came on the heels of two big-budget films that featured straight-up Hollywood whitewashing: &#x3C;i&#x3E;Doctor Strange&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, with Tilda Swinton in the role of an Asian character, and Scarlett Johansson in the then-upcoming anime adaptation &#x3C;i&#x3E;Ghost in the Shell&#x3C;/i&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p><b>I&rsquo;ve been watching</b> the nest cam again. The eaglets hatched and the mother eagle sits atop them and waits, like I wait, for the father eagle to return with a fish. On screen next to the nest cam is a live chat between a biology class and a wildlife expert. Questions appear quicker than the expert can reply to them. A student writes, "Doesn&rsquo;t look like they made their nest right <i>at all</i>." And it&rsquo;s true, the nest does seem sort of lopsided. I used to wait for the father because when the mother moved to feed the eaglets it allowed a better look at them, wobbly and covered in gray down. Lately, I&rsquo;m more interested in the father&rsquo;s catch. The fish is alive when he drops it into the nest and I imagine the feeling of being plucked from a river by expert talons, pulled from one element into a new one. Air, the first failure of my equipment. I bet it would feel like birth, cruel but important, and while eagles tore at my flesh, I&rsquo;d be nostalgic not for the water but for the moment I was removed from it, when I flew. How had I not known I could fly? I&rsquo;d be thinking.</p>











 <p>She demands so little of me now &mdash; a phone call every two weeks, a card on her birthday, a silencing of past grievances &mdash; but I still have a hard time giving it to her.</p>






<p>My mother never told me storks delivered babies but she did say yes when I asked if she&rsquo;d ever given a blow job. I was eight and didn&rsquo;t know what a blow job was &mdash; I must have overheard the phrase in school and asking if she&rsquo;d given one (actually, I think I said <i>done</i> not <i>given</i>, had she ever done a blow job) was a way of asking exactly what one was. She never did tell me. For years my proxy definition of blow job was: something my mother has given, something my mother has done. To be perfectly honest the phrase blow job still conjures stubborn memory wisps of my mother. I&rsquo;m thinking of her now. In the morning she&rsquo;d ask my sister and me what details we remembered from our dreams, and if we said being trapped in a castle or something, she&rsquo;d flip through her dream dictionary and interpret what our unconscious minds were hiding, never anything very good. Plus I could tell she left stuff out. As a teenager my sister stopped telling our mother her dreams but I never did. I started telling lies instead.</p><p>Whose little boy are you? she used to say when she was tired of me. Her eyes scanning my face without recognition, a menu of foods she didn&rsquo;t want in a language she didn&rsquo;t speak. Shouldn&rsquo;t you go look for your mommy?</p><p>I hated that. Whenever I remind her about it she acts like she doesn&rsquo;t remember. I bring it up more often than I should. My mother calls and we watch the nest cam together, her in Florida, me in California. She demands so little of me now &mdash; a phone call every two weeks, a card on her birthday, a silencing of past grievances &mdash; but I still have a hard time giving it to her. Talking to her makes me impatient, inversely annoyed with whatever she&rsquo;s excited about, even the nest cam. She and my sister fought over a dollhouse a few years ago and now my sister calls her <i>that woman</i> and rarely visits her. "I never thought you&rsquo;d turn out to be the normal one," my mother often tells me.</p>











 





<p><b>When I was</b> in elementary school she chaperoned a trip to Blue Springs to visit our class manatee, Randy. For months we wrote him letters, but all he sent were fun facts (Fun Fact&#33; All my teeth are molars&#33;) and autographed photos. "It&rsquo;s not even his signature," one of my classmates said disgustedly. We were excited anyway. When we arrived the guide pointed to a listless herd of manatees, ancient as dinosaur eggs in the clear water, and asked which was ours. Our teacher told him and the guide said, "Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry. Randy died a few nights ago."</p><p>He said it with such enthusiasm I thought he was joking. He went on about industrial contaminants and the delicate ecosystem of the spring. Kids who weren&rsquo;t afraid to cry cried. Others stared at the manatees. For some reason I reached for my mother&rsquo;s hand and held it. When it became clear that we were just going to hop back on the bus and leave, my mother let go of my hand, stamped over to the guide and said, "You could&rsquo;ve pointed to any of those fat-ass manatees and said &#39;there&rsquo;s Randy&#39; and nobody would&rsquo;ve known the difference."</p>











 <p>"What did we learn on our trip to Blue Springs?" our teacher asked. No one was sure.</p>






<p>I can&rsquo;t recall if he was defensive or chagrined, but neither he nor the teacher could placate her. Finally she said, "We want a new one. Today. We&rsquo;re not going anywhere until that happens." The guide left and we sat at picnic tables and ate bag lunches, thinking about Randy and his fun facts. The guide returned a half-hour later with a picture of our new manatee, Tammy. "Point her out," my mother said.</p><p>The guide indicated where Tammy was floating and told us how special she was because she&rsquo;d already given birth twice. Back in class, though, Randy&rsquo;s picture stayed on the wall and Tammy wasn&rsquo;t mentioned again. "What did we learn on our trip to Blue Springs?" our teacher asked. No one was sure.</p><p>My mother calls in the morning to tell me that the dead fish is still in the nest with the eagles. He spent all night there, head intact, body picked clean. First, water, then air, then a crooked bed of twigs. I&rsquo;m going to die without any idea what I&rsquo;m capable of. This is what I&rsquo;d be thinking, as eagles fed me to other eagles. &#x25CF;</p>

She never did tell me. For years my proxy definition of blow job was: something my mother has given, something my mother has done. To be perfectly honest the phrase blow job still conjures stubborn memory wisps of my mother. I&#x26;rsquo;m thinking of her now. In the morning she&#x26;rsquo;d ask my sister and me what details we remembered from our dreams, and if we said being trapped in a castle or something, she&#x26;rsquo;d flip through her dream dictionary and interpret what our unconscious minds were hiding, never anything very good. Plus I could tell she left stuff out. As a teenager my sister stopped telling our mother her dreams but I never did. I started telling lies instead.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Whose little boy are you? she used to say when she was tired of me. Her eyes scanning my face without recognition, a menu of foods she didn&#x26;rsquo;t want in a language she didn&#x26;rsquo;t speak. Shouldn&#x26;rsquo;t you go look for your mommy?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I hated that. Whenever I remind her about it she acts like she doesn&#x26;rsquo;t remember. I bring it up more often than I should. My mother calls and we watch the nest cam together, her in Florida, me in California. She demands so little of me now &#x26;mdash; a phone call every two weeks, a card on her birthday, a silencing of past grievances &#x26;mdash; but I still have a hard time giving it to her. Talking to her makes me impatient, inversely annoyed with whatever she&#x26;rsquo;s excited about, even the nest cam. She and my sister fought over a dollhouse a few years ago and now my sister calls her &#x3C;i&#x3E;that woman&#x3C;/i&#x3E; and rarely visits her. &#x22;I never thought you&#x26;rsquo;d turn out to be the normal one,&#x22; my mother often tells me.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 





&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;When I was&#x3C;/b&#x3E; in elementary school she chaperoned a trip to Blue Springs to visit our class manatee, Randy. For months we wrote him letters, but all he sent were fun facts (Fun Fact&#x26;#33; All my teeth are molars&#x26;#33;) and autographed photos. &#x22;It&#x26;rsquo;s not even his signature,&#x22; one of my classmates said disgustedly. We were excited anyway. When we arrived the guide pointed to a listless herd of manatees, ancient as dinosaur eggs in the clear water, and asked which was ours. Our teacher told him and the guide said, &#x22;Oh, I&#x26;rsquo;m so sorry. Randy died a few nights ago.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He said it with such enthusiasm I thought he was joking. He went on about industrial contaminants and the delicate ecosystem of the spring. Kids who weren&#x26;rsquo;t afraid to cry cried. Others stared at the manatees. For some reason I reached for my mother&#x26;rsquo;s hand and held it. When it became clear that we were just going to hop back on the bus and leave, my mother let go of my hand, stamped over to the guide and said, &#x22;You could&#x26;rsquo;ve pointed to any of those fat-ass manatees and said &#x26;#39;there&#x26;rsquo;s Randy&#x26;#39; and nobody would&#x26;rsquo;ve known the difference.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;What did we learn on our trip to Blue Springs?&#x22; our teacher asked. No one was sure.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;I can&#x26;rsquo;t recall if he was defensive or chagrined, but neither he nor the teacher could placate her. Finally she said, &#x22;We want a new one. Today. We&#x26;rsquo;re not going anywhere until that happens.&#x22; The guide left and we sat at picnic tables and ate bag lunches, thinking about Randy and his fun facts. The guide returned a half-hour later with a picture of our new manatee, Tammy. &#x22;Point her out,&#x22; my mother said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The guide indicated where Tammy was floating and told us how special she was because she&#x26;rsquo;d already given birth twice. Back in class, though, Randy&#x26;rsquo;s picture stayed on the wall and Tammy wasn&#x26;rsquo;t mentioned again. &#x22;What did we learn on our trip to Blue Springs?&#x22; our teacher asked. No one was sure.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;My mother calls in the morning to tell me that the dead fish is still in the nest with the eagles. He spent all night there, head intact, body picked clean. First, water, then air, then a crooked bed of twigs. I&#x26;rsquo;m going to die without any idea what I&#x26;rsquo;m capable of. This is what I&#x26;rsquo;d be thinking, as eagles fed me to other eagles. &#x26;#x25CF;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

	<p>Kelly Clarkson performs songs from her new album <i>Meaning of Life</i> at The Rainbow Room on Sept. 6 in New York City.</p>

<p>Kelly Clarkson loves to tell us how ordinary she is. The pop star, whose eighth studio album <i>Meaning of Life</i> is out today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/music/kelly-clarkson-meaning-of-life-interview.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;mtrref=t.co">listens to Pink</a>, watches <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/music/kelly-clarkson-meaning-of-life-interview.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;mtrref=t.co"><i>Game of Thrones</i></a>, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521">reads Jane Austen</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/909249325246615554">posts gifs proclaiming how nervous she gets around famous people</a> on Twitter. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/music/kelly-clarkson-meaning-of-life-interview.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;mtrref=t.co">New York Times interview</a> published last week, Clarkson returned from a bathroom break, proclaiming &ldquo;Wow, I really had to pee&#33; That was a lot&#33;&rdquo;</p><p>Since she first beamed into viewers&rsquo; homes on <i>American Idol</i> 15 years ago, Clarkson&rsquo;s forthrightness &mdash; paired with her powerhouse voice &mdash; has been a large part of her appeal. Like a slightly more conservative Adele (Clarkson <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521">still sometimes says &ldquo;frigging&rdquo;</a> instead of the other f word), she has always been lacking in pretension. And it&rsquo;s worked for her; she&rsquo;s had three No. 1 hits, won three Grammys, and sold more than 25 million albums worldwide.</p><p>In the last two years, Clarkson&rsquo;s outspokenness has begun to take on a more pointed political and cultural &mdash; as opposed to purely personal &mdash; bent. She&rsquo;s spoken out about <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521">legalizing marijuana</a>, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521">putting a woman on the $20 bill</a>, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521">Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s run for president</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/912127788668219393">NFL protests</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/897304977990852614">Heather Heyer</a> and, well, pretty much everything. &ldquo;I actually came with a brain, not just vocal cords, and it would be silly not to have an opinion,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/music/kelly-clarkson-meaning-of-life-interview.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;mtrref=t.co">she told the New York Times</a>. &ldquo;It would be a <i>disgrace</i> if I didn&rsquo;t have an opinion.&rdquo; Her new album &mdash; the first on her new label Atlantic Records &mdash; suggests that she&rsquo;s firmly embracing her autonomy and willing to subtly address some of the larger cultural conversations she&rsquo;s begun to be a part of.</p><p>In an era where every aspect of American culture is politicized, some celebrities are navigating how to present their political opinions publicly for the first time. Throughout the 2016 election, many celebrities were vocal about politics, but few had a background similar to Clarkson&rsquo;s: a white woman from a big red state (Texas), with a fanbase all over the country. Taylor Swift <a href="https://splinternews.com/it-s-time-for-taylor-swift-to-say-something-about-donal-1793862658">remained notably silent</a> during the entire 2016 campaign, and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/carrie-underwood-on-presidential-election-solving-world-problems-20160219">the only public comment</a> Carrie Underwood made about the election was a <a href="http://www.qpolitical.com/48-hours-after-the-debate-carrie-underwood-posts-a-shocking-confession/">joke about running herself</a>. Clarkson could have stayed quiet too, and her politicization is a risk. With artists&rsquo; political views so woven into the perception of their art, what she does or doesn&rsquo;t say could determine not only whether her current fanbase stays loyal, but whether she continues to be relevant in the pop music landscape at all.</p>

<p><b>Kelly Clarkson first</b> came to the public&rsquo;s attention as a spunky 20-year-old cocktail waitress from Burleson, Texas, who just wanted to sing. In the intro for her <i>American Idol</i> audition, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcvvOZ6LQ1g">Clarkson chats</a> with a frosted-tipped Ryan Seacrest, wearing a denim shirt she made out of a pair of pants. Before belting out a verse of Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Express Yourself&rdquo; for the judges, she responds to their small talk with a &ldquo;Cool beans.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s gregarious, thrilled to be there, and in seconds has somehow switched spots with Randy and is sitting behind the judge&#39;s desk. It&rsquo;s a stunt that works. She&rsquo;s believable, relatable, and she gets her golden ticket to Hollywood.</p><p>&ldquo;She had that kind of spunky Texas personality very much intact, and it gave people an authentic feeling that was easy to root for,&rdquo; says Richard Rushfield, who covered <i>American Idol</i> for the Los Angeles Times and wrote the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Idol-Untold-Richard-Rushfield/dp/1401324126"><i>American Idol: The Untold Story</i></a>. [Editor&rsquo;s note: Rushfield also worked for BuzzFeed News from 2012 to 2013.]</p><p>Viewers liked Clarkson on <i>Idol</i> &mdash; she was never at risk for elimination by being in the bottom three &mdash; but most of the initial buzz was around fan favorites Justin Guarini, Nikki McKibbin, and Tamyra Gray. &ldquo;Four or five weeks before the finale, no one was talking about Kelly Clarkson,&rdquo; Rushfield says. &ldquo;So it ended up being this kind of beautiful underdog story: The farm girl from Texas upset this glossy pretty boy and anointed winner.&rdquo; Clarkson eventually won the popular vote in the finale with <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1457324/kelly-clarkson-crowned-american-idol/">58%.</a> Her winners&rsquo; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC21yoI8Di8">performance</a> of &ldquo;A Moment Like This&rdquo; was classic, unfiltered Clarkson. Overcome with emotion, she let out happy squeals and could barely sing the lines, apologizing into the mic.</p><p>But even though the contestants&rsquo; inexperience was part of the inherent appeal of <i>Idol</i>, Clarkson &mdash; like her peers in future seasons, Carrie Underwood and Jennifer Hudson &mdash; had more professional experience than the producers let on. After high school graduation, Clarkson produced a demo and sent it to record labels. She was <a href="http://ew.com/article/2002/12/13/was-kelly-clarkson-pro-idol/">offered a couple of recording contracts,</a> but none to her liking, and even moved to Los Angeles to try to make it big. <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/idol-worship/7318959/american-idol-beginning-season-1-memories-kelly-clarkson">She failed,</a> and returned to Burleson, but she wasn&rsquo;t naive about how the music industry worked. That&rsquo;s likely part of why Clarkson&rsquo;s been able to survive in a volatile industry since winning <i>Idol</i>, while many of her fellow finalists have not. (Of the 42 <i>American Idol</i> finalists, only 14 have been on tour in the last three years, and only 19 have produced new music since 2013.)</p>

<p>Almost every <i>Idol</i> finalist struggled to make it past their second album. Season 2 winner Ruben Studdard&rsquo;s first album, for example, went No. 1 and sold almost 2 million copies; his second sold almost a fourth that. Kelly Clarkson didn&rsquo;t fall off that cliff. Her 2004 album <i>Breakaway</i> was a massive success, hitting No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and producing some of her most famous singles, like &ldquo;Since U Been Gone&rdquo; and &ldquo;Because of You.&rdquo;</p><p>But Clarkson had to fight to get the album she wanted, employing (behind the scenes) the same outspokenness that has become a more and more central component of her public image. There was <a href="http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/">well-publicized feud</a> with music executive Clive Davis, who took over her record label in 2004, in which Clarkson later suggested that Davis and other producers (Dr. Luke and Max Martin) <a href="http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/">discredited her songwriting ability</a> and tried to force her to make pop songs instead of the soul music she loved.</p><p>&ldquo;A group of men thought it was OK to sit around a young woman and bully her. I was told I should shut up and sing,&rdquo; Clarkson <a href="http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/">told</a> Variety last month. Instead of backing down, Clarkson demanded that she at <a href="http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/">least get to cowrite the songs</a> on the album, and later that Davis release her third studio album, <i>My December,</i> in 2007 after <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/idol-worship/kelly-clarkson-slams-clive-davis-422397">he tried to bury it</a>.</p><p>In 2009, Clarkson cowrote her 2009 single &ldquo;My Life Would Suck Without You&rdquo; with producer Dr. Luke (n&eacute;e Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald), who has since <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiarosenbaum/kesha-dr-luke-legal-history?utm_term=.daywGPzvdo#.ovmM5RdPbm">been accused</a> of sexual assault and harassment by Kesha (Dr. Luke denied the claims; Kesha eventually <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiarosenbaum/kesha-drops-sex-assault-case-against-dr-luke?utm_term=.foZ3ALoDY6#.ikPyvL8wlR">dropped her lawsuit</a> against him). When the label tried to give Clarkson credit for cowriting the song, though, she refused. She wanted to make &ldquo;a point to the people working with me,&rdquo; she <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kelly-clarkson-i-lost-millions-over-dr-luke-disagreement-w503123">told Z100</a> in September, that she didn&rsquo;t want her name next to his. During Kesha&rsquo;s trial against Dr. Luke, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kelly-clarkson-i-was-blackmailed-by-label-to-work-with-dr-luke-20160307">Clarkson publicly and adamantly</a> took Kesha&rsquo;s side, claiming that Clarkson&rsquo;s label forced her to work with the producer.</p><p>Though Clarkson has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/04/kelly-clarkson-determination-celebrity-grammys-jane-austen-interview">always been noticeably outspoken</a> compared to other pop stars with a similar audience and reach, for years that manifested almost entirely in speaking about her own career. When Live Nation canceled her 2004 <i>My December</i> tour because of low ticket sales, Clarkson <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1562493/kelly-clarkson-calls-off-summer-tour/">told Elle magazine</a> that Clive Davis offered her $10 million to drop five songs he didn&rsquo;t like off the album in favor of poppier hits. "My resistance upsets a lot of people, because we could make a lot of money," Clarkson said in the interview, &ldquo;And I&#39;m not hatin&#39; on money. ... I&#39;m just not comfortable doing things that don&#39;t feel like me."</p><p>More recently, Clarkson has commented not just on professional issues, but on personal ones too. After extensive comments about her weight fluctuations, Clarkson <a href="https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/882430011084599296">shut down body-shamers</a> on Twitter, and <a href="http://attitude.co.uk/kelly-clarkson-weight-skinny-wanted-kill-myself/">recently told Attitude magazine</a> that, at the beginning of her career, &ldquo;When I was really skinny, [...] I was miserable, like inside and out, for four years of my life. But no one cared, because aesthetically you make sense.&rdquo; On her new album, she addresses those conversations head-on in a song titled &ldquo;Whole Lotta Woman.&rdquo; And she&rsquo;s not afraid to dig into the larger cultural implications of her own experiences. Talking about the song <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-i-am-a-whole-lot-of-woman-and-thats-ok-w510320">to Rolling Stone</a> this week, she said, &ldquo;I am a whole lot of woman &mdash; I have a big personality, I&#39;m a grown-ass woman that can pay her bills, and I make a lot of money. That&#39;s intimidating."</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a puppet&rdquo; is one of Clarkson&rsquo;s favorite phrases. She said it in 2009 <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/im-not-as-controversial-as-the-media-portrays-1011678">during her album promotion</a> as well. But only recently has her candidness translated into the political sphere, where it has the potential to wipe away some of that public goodwill she&rsquo;s spent so much time building up.</p>

<p><b>For the first decade</b> of her career, as she released hits like &ldquo;Since U Been Gone,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stronger (What Doesn&rsquo;t Kill You),&rdquo; Clarkson remained mostly silent on political matters. &ldquo;My family was highly conservative; I had to go to church on Sunday and Wednesday,&rdquo; she <a href="http://ew.com/article/2011/08/31/kelly-clarkson-on-the-soundtrack-of-her-life-read-her-exclusive-ew-interview-here/">told EW in 2004</a>. Her home town of Burleson, just outside of Fort Worth, Texas, bleeds into two counties, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/09/see-which-counties-texas-trump-and-clinton-won/">both red:</a> Tarrant County went 52.2% for Trump, and Johnson County went 77.5%.<br /></p><p>But since 2008, Clarkson&rsquo;s public politics have increasingly leaned left. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m probably going to vote for Obama again, even though I&rsquo;m a Republican at heart,&rdquo; she <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/playlist/277766/Kelly-Clarkson-falls-for-UK">told a British reporter</a> in 2012. She also tweeted favorably about Ron Paul, which created <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/29/kelly-clarkson-endorses-ron-paul-twitter-hate_n_1174612.html">some backlash,</a> and said that <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/kelly-clarkson-endorses-obama-gay-marriage-stance_n_2006018.html">she couldn&rsquo;t vote for Mitt Romney</a> because of her belief in LGBT rights. &ldquo;I have a lot of gay friends and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair they can&#39;t get married,&rdquo; Clarkson told the Daily Star in 2012, <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/">a year when only 48%</a> of Americans believed gay marriage should be legal. When Obama was reelected, she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=034fNYyY9HU">sang at his inauguration</a> ceremony. In 2016, she cast her vote for Hillary Clinton after <a href="https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/691801310551785472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2Farticles%2Fnews%2F6851854%2Fkelly-clarkson-donald-trump-bette-midler-twitter">tweeting that Donald Trump</a> made her &ldquo;genuinely frightened for our nation.&rdquo; She performed on Michelle Obama&rsquo;s female empowerment song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY7-WaGYA60">&ldquo;This Is for My Girls,&rdquo;</a> and one of <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/350345-kelly-clarkson-says-new-song-go-high-inspired-by-michelle-obama">the songs on her new album</a>, &ldquo;Go High,&rdquo; is inspired by the former first lady&rsquo;s &ldquo;when they go low, we go high,&rdquo; speech &mdash; which Clarkson <a href="http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/">calls</a> &ldquo;the speech heard round the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Staying moderate, for any person, much less a celebrity, is becoming more and more difficult. According to a <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2017/10/24/political-typology-reveals-deep-fissures-on-the-right-and-left/">recent poll by the Pew Research Center</a>, the country&rsquo;s partisan divide on fundamental political values is greater than it&rsquo;s ever been, and &ldquo;in Donald Trump&rsquo;s first year as president, these gaps have grown even larger.&rdquo; It seems clear which side of that divide Clarkson has settled on. When the president tweeted that NFL attendance was down because of peaceful protests during the playing of the national anthem, Clarkson mockingly <a href="https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/912121359924264960">quote-tweeted him:</a> &ldquo;The NFL is obviously super poor guys and in need of our attendance/ratings .....said no one ever. #billiondollarindustry&rdquo;</p><p>When a fan replied, asking &ldquo;why must you celebrities spew negativity? Do you recall the Dixie Chicks?&rdquo; Clarkson didn&rsquo;t let up. "Who&#39;s spewing negativity? &amp; please stop using the &#39;celebrity&#39; thing,&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/912127788668219393">she tweeted back</a>. &ldquo;I&#39;m a Texas girl who loves football &amp; the NFL is doing just fine."</p>

	&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kelly Clarkson performs songs from her new album &#x3C;i&#x3E;Meaning of Life&#x3C;/i&#x3E; at The Rainbow Room on Sept. 6 in New York City.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kelly Clarkson loves to tell us how ordinary she is. The pop star, whose eighth studio album &#x3C;i&#x3E;Meaning of Life&#x3C;/i&#x3E; is out today, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/music/kelly-clarkson-meaning-of-life-interview.html?smid=tw-nytimes&#x26;amp;smtyp=cur&#x26;amp;mtrref=t.co&#x22;&#x3E;listens to Pink&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, watches &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/music/kelly-clarkson-meaning-of-life-interview.html?smid=tw-nytimes&#x26;amp;smtyp=cur&#x26;amp;mtrref=t.co&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Game of Thrones&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521&#x22;&#x3E;reads Jane Austen&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/909249325246615554&#x22;&#x3E;posts gifs proclaiming how nervous she gets around famous people&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on Twitter. In a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/music/kelly-clarkson-meaning-of-life-interview.html?smid=tw-nytimes&#x26;amp;smtyp=cur&#x26;amp;mtrref=t.co&#x22;&#x3E;New York Times interview&#x3C;/a&#x3E; published last week, Clarkson returned from a bathroom break, proclaiming &#x26;ldquo;Wow, I really had to pee&#x26;#33; That was a lot&#x26;#33;&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Since she first beamed into viewers&#x26;rsquo; homes on &#x3C;i&#x3E;American Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E; 15 years ago, Clarkson&#x26;rsquo;s forthrightness &#x26;mdash; paired with her powerhouse voice &#x26;mdash; has been a large part of her appeal. Like a slightly more conservative Adele (Clarkson &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521&#x22;&#x3E;still sometimes says &#x26;ldquo;frigging&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; instead of the other f word), she has always been lacking in pretension. And it&#x26;rsquo;s worked for her; she&#x26;rsquo;s had three No. 1 hits, won three Grammys, and sold more than 25 million albums worldwide.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the last two years, Clarkson&#x26;rsquo;s outspokenness has begun to take on a more pointed political and cultural &#x26;mdash; as opposed to purely personal &#x26;mdash; bent. She&#x26;rsquo;s spoken out about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521&#x22;&#x3E;legalizing marijuana&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521&#x22;&#x3E;putting a woman on the $20 bill&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-on-legal-weed-supporting-hillary-and-backgammon-with-reba-20150521&#x22;&#x3E;Hillary Clinton&#x26;rsquo;s run for president&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/912127788668219393&#x22;&#x3E;NFL protests&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/897304977990852614&#x22;&#x3E;Heather Heyer&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and, well, pretty much everything. &#x26;ldquo;I actually came with a brain, not just vocal cords, and it would be silly not to have an opinion,&#x26;rdquo; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/music/kelly-clarkson-meaning-of-life-interview.html?smid=tw-nytimes&#x26;amp;smtyp=cur&#x26;amp;mtrref=t.co&#x22;&#x3E;she told the New York Times&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. &#x26;ldquo;It would be a &#x3C;i&#x3E;disgrace&#x3C;/i&#x3E; if I didn&#x26;rsquo;t have an opinion.&#x26;rdquo; Her new album &#x26;mdash; the first on her new label Atlantic Records &#x26;mdash; suggests that she&#x26;rsquo;s firmly embracing her autonomy and willing to subtly address some of the larger cultural conversations she&#x26;rsquo;s begun to be a part of.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In an era where every aspect of American culture is politicized, some celebrities are navigating how to present their political opinions publicly for the first time. Throughout the 2016 election, many celebrities were vocal about politics, but few had a background similar to Clarkson&#x26;rsquo;s: a white woman from a big red state (Texas), with a fanbase all over the country. Taylor Swift &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://splinternews.com/it-s-time-for-taylor-swift-to-say-something-about-donal-1793862658&#x22;&#x3E;remained notably silent&#x3C;/a&#x3E; during the entire 2016 campaign, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/carrie-underwood-on-presidential-election-solving-world-problems-20160219&#x22;&#x3E;the only public comment&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Carrie Underwood made about the election was a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.qpolitical.com/48-hours-after-the-debate-carrie-underwood-posts-a-shocking-confession/&#x22;&#x3E;joke about running herself&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Clarkson could have stayed quiet too, and her politicization is a risk. With artists&#x26;rsquo; political views so woven into the perception of their art, what she does or doesn&#x26;rsquo;t say could determine not only whether her current fanbase stays loyal, but whether she continues to be relevant in the pop music landscape at all.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

	&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kelly Clarkson (center) is embraced by &#x3C;i&#x3E;Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E; contestants after winning &#x3C;i&#x3E;American Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E; in 2002.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;


 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Kevin Winter / Kevin Winter/ImageDirect&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Kelly Clarkson first&#x3C;/b&#x3E; came to the public&#x26;rsquo;s attention as a spunky 20-year-old cocktail waitress from Burleson, Texas, who just wanted to sing. In the intro for her &#x3C;i&#x3E;American Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E; audition, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcvvOZ6LQ1g&#x22;&#x3E;Clarkson chats&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with a frosted-tipped Ryan Seacrest, wearing a denim shirt she made out of a pair of pants. Before belting out a verse of Madonna&#x26;rsquo;s &#x26;ldquo;Express Yourself&#x26;rdquo; for the judges, she responds to their small talk with a &#x26;ldquo;Cool beans.&#x26;rdquo; She&#x26;rsquo;s gregarious, thrilled to be there, and in seconds has somehow switched spots with Randy and is sitting behind the judge&#x26;#39;s desk. It&#x26;rsquo;s a stunt that works. She&#x26;rsquo;s believable, relatable, and she gets her golden ticket to Hollywood.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;She had that kind of spunky Texas personality very much intact, and it gave people an authentic feeling that was easy to root for,&#x26;rdquo; says Richard Rushfield, who covered &#x3C;i&#x3E;American Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E; for the Los Angeles Times and wrote the book &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.amazon.com/American-Idol-Untold-Richard-Rushfield/dp/1401324126&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;American Idol: The Untold Story&#x3C;/i&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. [Editor&#x26;rsquo;s note: Rushfield also worked for BuzzFeed News from 2012 to 2013.]&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Viewers liked Clarkson on &#x3C;i&#x3E;Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; she was never at risk for elimination by being in the bottom three &#x26;mdash; but most of the initial buzz was around fan favorites Justin Guarini, Nikki McKibbin, and Tamyra Gray. &#x26;ldquo;Four or five weeks before the finale, no one was talking about Kelly Clarkson,&#x26;rdquo; Rushfield says. &#x26;ldquo;So it ended up being this kind of beautiful underdog story: The farm girl from Texas upset this glossy pretty boy and anointed winner.&#x26;rdquo; Clarkson eventually won the popular vote in the finale with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.mtv.com/news/1457324/kelly-clarkson-crowned-american-idol/&#x22;&#x3E;58%.&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Her winners&#x26;rsquo; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC21yoI8Di8&#x22;&#x3E;performance&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of &#x26;ldquo;A Moment Like This&#x26;rdquo; was classic, unfiltered Clarkson. Overcome with emotion, she let out happy squeals and could barely sing the lines, apologizing into the mic.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But even though the contestants&#x26;rsquo; inexperience was part of the inherent appeal of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, Clarkson &#x26;mdash; like her peers in future seasons, Carrie Underwood and Jennifer Hudson &#x26;mdash; had more professional experience than the producers let on. After high school graduation, Clarkson produced a demo and sent it to record labels. She was &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://ew.com/article/2002/12/13/was-kelly-clarkson-pro-idol/&#x22;&#x3E;offered a couple of recording contracts,&#x3C;/a&#x3E; but none to her liking, and even moved to Los Angeles to try to make it big. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/idol-worship/7318959/american-idol-beginning-season-1-memories-kelly-clarkson&#x22;&#x3E;She failed,&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and returned to Burleson, but she wasn&#x26;rsquo;t naive about how the music industry worked. That&#x26;rsquo;s likely part of why Clarkson&#x26;rsquo;s been able to survive in a volatile industry since winning &#x3C;i&#x3E;Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, while many of her fellow finalists have not. (Of the 42 &#x3C;i&#x3E;American Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E; finalists, only 14 have been on tour in the last three years, and only 19 have produced new music since 2013.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Almost every &#x3C;i&#x3E;Idol&#x3C;/i&#x3E; finalist struggled to make it past their second album. Season 2 winner Ruben Studdard&#x26;rsquo;s first album, for example, went No. 1 and sold almost 2 million copies; his second sold almost a fourth that. Kelly Clarkson didn&#x26;rsquo;t fall off that cliff. Her 2004 album &#x3C;i&#x3E;Breakaway&#x3C;/i&#x3E; was a massive success, hitting No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and producing some of her most famous singles, like &#x26;ldquo;Since U Been Gone&#x26;rdquo; and &#x26;ldquo;Because of You.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But Clarkson had to fight to get the album she wanted, employing (behind the scenes) the same outspokenness that has become a more and more central component of her public image. There was &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/&#x22;&#x3E;well-publicized feud&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with music executive Clive Davis, who took over her record label in 2004, in which Clarkson later suggested that Davis and other producers (Dr. Luke and Max Martin) &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/&#x22;&#x3E;discredited her songwriting ability&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and tried to force her to make pop songs instead of the soul music she loved.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;A group of men thought it was OK to sit around a young woman and bully her. I was told I should shut up and sing,&#x26;rdquo; Clarkson &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/&#x22;&#x3E;told&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Variety last month. Instead of backing down, Clarkson demanded that she at &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/&#x22;&#x3E;least get to cowrite the songs&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on the album, and later that Davis release her third studio album, &#x3C;i&#x3E;My December,&#x3C;/i&#x3E; in 2007 after &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/idol-worship/kelly-clarkson-slams-clive-davis-422397&#x22;&#x3E;he tried to bury it&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In 2009, Clarkson cowrote her 2009 single &#x26;ldquo;My Life Would Suck Without You&#x26;rdquo; with producer Dr. Luke (n&#x26;eacute;e Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald), who has since &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiarosenbaum/kesha-dr-luke-legal-history?utm_term=.daywGPzvdo#.ovmM5RdPbm&#x22;&#x3E;been accused&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of sexual assault and harassment by Kesha (Dr. Luke denied the claims; Kesha eventually &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiarosenbaum/kesha-drops-sex-assault-case-against-dr-luke?utm_term=.foZ3ALoDY6#.ikPyvL8wlR&#x22;&#x3E;dropped her lawsuit&#x3C;/a&#x3E; against him). When the label tried to give Clarkson credit for cowriting the song, though, she refused. She wanted to make &#x26;ldquo;a point to the people working with me,&#x26;rdquo; she &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kelly-clarkson-i-lost-millions-over-dr-luke-disagreement-w503123&#x22;&#x3E;told Z100&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in September, that she didn&#x26;rsquo;t want her name next to his. During Kesha&#x26;rsquo;s trial against Dr. Luke, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kelly-clarkson-i-was-blackmailed-by-label-to-work-with-dr-luke-20160307&#x22;&#x3E;Clarkson publicly and adamantly&#x3C;/a&#x3E; took Kesha&#x26;rsquo;s side, claiming that Clarkson&#x26;rsquo;s label forced her to work with the producer.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Though Clarkson has &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/04/kelly-clarkson-determination-celebrity-grammys-jane-austen-interview&#x22;&#x3E;always been noticeably outspoken&#x3C;/a&#x3E; compared to other pop stars with a similar audience and reach, for years that manifested almost entirely in speaking about her own career. When Live Nation canceled her 2004 &#x3C;i&#x3E;My December&#x3C;/i&#x3E; tour because of low ticket sales, Clarkson &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.mtv.com/news/1562493/kelly-clarkson-calls-off-summer-tour/&#x22;&#x3E;told Elle magazine&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that Clive Davis offered her $10 million to drop five songs he didn&#x26;rsquo;t like off the album in favor of poppier hits. &#x22;My resistance upsets a lot of people, because we could make a lot of money,&#x22; Clarkson said in the interview, &#x26;ldquo;And I&#x26;#39;m not hatin&#x26;#39; on money. ... I&#x26;#39;m just not comfortable doing things that don&#x26;#39;t feel like me.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;More recently, Clarkson has commented not just on professional issues, but on personal ones too. After extensive comments about her weight fluctuations, Clarkson &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/882430011084599296&#x22;&#x3E;shut down body-shamers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on Twitter, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://attitude.co.uk/kelly-clarkson-weight-skinny-wanted-kill-myself/&#x22;&#x3E;recently told Attitude magazine&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that, at the beginning of her career, &#x26;ldquo;When I was really skinny, [...] I was miserable, like inside and out, for four years of my life. But no one cared, because aesthetically you make sense.&#x26;rdquo; On her new album, she addresses those conversations head-on in a song titled &#x26;ldquo;Whole Lotta Woman.&#x26;rdquo; And she&#x26;rsquo;s not afraid to dig into the larger cultural implications of her own experiences. Talking about the song &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kelly-clarkson-i-am-a-whole-lot-of-woman-and-thats-ok-w510320&#x22;&#x3E;to Rolling Stone&#x3C;/a&#x3E; this week, she said, &#x26;ldquo;I am a whole lot of woman &#x26;mdash; I have a big personality, I&#x26;#39;m a grown-ass woman that can pay her bills, and I make a lot of money. That&#x26;#39;s intimidating.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;m not a puppet&#x26;rdquo; is one of Clarkson&#x26;rsquo;s favorite phrases. She said it in 2009 &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/im-not-as-controversial-as-the-media-portrays-1011678&#x22;&#x3E;during her album promotion&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as well. But only recently has her candidness translated into the political sphere, where it has the potential to wipe away some of that public goodwill she&#x26;rsquo;s spent so much time building up.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;For the first decade&#x3C;/b&#x3E; of her career, as she released hits like &#x26;ldquo;Since U Been Gone,&#x26;rdquo; and &#x26;ldquo;Stronger (What Doesn&#x26;rsquo;t Kill You),&#x26;rdquo; Clarkson remained mostly silent on political matters. &#x26;ldquo;My family was highly conservative; I had to go to church on Sunday and Wednesday,&#x26;rdquo; she &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://ew.com/article/2011/08/31/kelly-clarkson-on-the-soundtrack-of-her-life-read-her-exclusive-ew-interview-here/&#x22;&#x3E;told EW in 2004&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Her home town of Burleson, just outside of Fort Worth, Texas, bleeds into two counties, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/09/see-which-counties-texas-trump-and-clinton-won/&#x22;&#x3E;both red:&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Tarrant County went 52.2% for Trump, and Johnson County went 77.5%.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But since 2008, Clarkson&#x26;rsquo;s public politics have increasingly leaned left. &#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;m probably going to vote for Obama again, even though I&#x26;rsquo;m a Republican at heart,&#x26;rdquo; she &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/playlist/277766/Kelly-Clarkson-falls-for-UK&#x22;&#x3E;told a British reporter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in 2012. She also tweeted favorably about Ron Paul, which created &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/29/kelly-clarkson-endorses-ron-paul-twitter-hate_n_1174612.html&#x22;&#x3E;some backlash,&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and said that &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/kelly-clarkson-endorses-obama-gay-marriage-stance_n_2006018.html&#x22;&#x3E;she couldn&#x26;rsquo;t vote for Mitt Romney&#x3C;/a&#x3E; because of her belief in LGBT rights. &#x26;ldquo;I have a lot of gay friends and I don&#x26;#39;t think it&#x26;#39;s fair they can&#x26;#39;t get married,&#x26;rdquo; Clarkson told the Daily Star in 2012, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/&#x22;&#x3E;a year when only 48%&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of Americans believed gay marriage should be legal. When Obama was reelected, she &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=034fNYyY9HU&#x22;&#x3E;sang at his inauguration&#x3C;/a&#x3E; ceremony. In 2016, she cast her vote for Hillary Clinton after &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/691801310551785472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#x26;amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2Farticles%2Fnews%2F6851854%2Fkelly-clarkson-donald-trump-bette-midler-twitter&#x22;&#x3E;tweeting that Donald Trump&#x3C;/a&#x3E; made her &#x26;ldquo;genuinely frightened for our nation.&#x26;rdquo; She performed on Michelle Obama&#x26;rsquo;s female empowerment song &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY7-WaGYA60&#x22;&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;This Is for My Girls,&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and one of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/350345-kelly-clarkson-says-new-song-go-high-inspired-by-michelle-obama&#x22;&#x3E;the songs on her new album&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x26;ldquo;Go High,&#x26;rdquo; is inspired by the former first lady&#x26;rsquo;s &#x26;ldquo;when they go low, we go high,&#x26;rdquo; speech &#x26;mdash; which Clarkson &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://variety.com/2017/music/features/kelly-clarkson-new-album-the-voice-clive-davis-1202584426/&#x22;&#x3E;calls&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x26;ldquo;the speech heard round the world.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Staying moderate, for any person, much less a celebrity, is becoming more and more difficult. According to a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.people-press.org/2017/10/24/political-typology-reveals-deep-fissures-on-the-right-and-left/&#x22;&#x3E;recent poll by the Pew Research Center&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the country&#x26;rsquo;s partisan divide on fundamental political values is greater than it&#x26;rsquo;s ever been, and &#x26;ldquo;in Donald Trump&#x26;rsquo;s first year as president, these gaps have grown even larger.&#x26;rdquo; It seems clear which side of that divide Clarkson has settled on. When the president tweeted that NFL attendance was down because of peaceful protests during the playing of the national anthem, Clarkson mockingly &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/912121359924264960&#x22;&#x3E;quote-tweeted him:&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x26;ldquo;The NFL is obviously super poor guys and in need of our attendance/ratings .....said no one ever. #billiondollarindustry&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;When a fan replied, asking &#x26;ldquo;why must you celebrities spew negativity? Do you recall the Dixie Chicks?&#x26;rdquo; Clarkson didn&#x26;rsquo;t let up. &#x22;Who&#x26;#39;s spewing negativity? &#x26;amp; please stop using the &#x26;#39;celebrity&#x26;#39; thing,&#x26;rdquo; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/kelly_clarkson/status/912127788668219393&#x22;&#x3E;she tweeted back&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. &#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;#39;m a Texas girl who loves football &#x26;amp; the NFL is doing just fine.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;Staying moderate, for any person, much less a celebrity, is becoming more and more difficult.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

 <p><small>Julien Pacaud for BuzzFeed News</small></p>




<p><b>The town itself</b> was interesting enough, with crumbling houses and narrow streets full of people who seemed not to know how to hurry. I learned to walk slowly and so this pace was not difficult for me. That day was absurdly sunny. In the afternoon I rode the one of the funiculars to the top of a hill, an outcropping of rock high above the sea where the wind blew so hard it forced my eyes shut and dusted my face with a fine film. From there, between gusts, I could see the port, its gleaming metal claws, its workers scurrying between acres of containers stacked one on top of the other. Beyond it was the ocean, a beautiful, roiling sheet of silver.</p>











 <p>Of course the real work of the day was pretending I wasn&rsquo;t lonely.</p>






<p>Of course the real work of the day was pretending I wasn&rsquo;t lonely. By late afternoon I had given up, so I went to a bar down in the flats, a place that looked and smelled like the inside of a ship: the air was sooty and humid, the walls were held up by wooden beams curved like ribs. At any moment I thought they would give and the ocean would leak through, slowly at first, then with a deafening crash, and drown us all. There were five or six men at the bar. None sat together.</p><p>Nearly every inch of the place was covered with photographs: of politicians and starlets, soccer players and singers. The wall behind the bar was reserved for portraits of garlanded racehorses and their jockeys. I read for a bit, but the light was dim and I could barely make out the words. There was no music and very little conversation. The men nodded at the bartender, and drinks appeared before them in almost soundless transactions. I was there an hour before anyone said a word to me. It was an older gentleman in a worn navy sport coat. He said: &ldquo;You read so beautifully.&rdquo;</p><p>The way I felt in those days, it wouldn&rsquo;t have surprised me in the slightest to discover that I&rsquo;d been reading aloud. I blanched. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so still.&rdquo;</p><p>Which struck me as funny. I&rsquo;d been traveling at that point for eight weeks and already the town was fading. The next day I would be heading south, relentlessly southward, and in ten days I would be home again for the first time in two years. But I suppose everything about me gave the impression of a wounded man, determined not to move. I had not spoken to my wife in many months. The effort it took not to think of her was so great that in the evenings my bones ached.</p>











 <p>I suppose everything about me gave the impression of a wounded man, determined not to move.</p>






<p>&ldquo;Cheers,&rdquo; I said.</p><p>He told me his name was Marcial. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m retired,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful.&rdquo; He paused, as if expecting me to respond, but I didn&rsquo;t. I must have glanced down at my book again. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>He was unshaven and had a tired look to him. His hair was completely, shockingly white. I passed him the book. It was all so tactile: he felt its texture, fanned its pages roughly, and smiled at the satisfying sound they made. He commented on the novel&rsquo;s weight. There was a woman on the cover, a stern, dark-haired beauty, looking down a Paris street. Or something like that. He ran his index finger over her face. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>We clinked glasses. &ldquo;I want you to understand my story,&rdquo; Marcial said. &ldquo;When my wife died, I told our children that I would drink for a year and then find a new woman.&rdquo;</p><p>It was difficult to tell in the low light if he was a man at the beginning or the end of a yearlong bender. &ldquo;How is that working out?&rdquo;</p><p>His beard was growing in white. He scratched the stubble. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have three months to go.&rdquo;</p><p>Eventually a television came on, and I pretended to read while Marcial followed a soccer match with muted enthusiasm. There was a red team and a blue team. When pressed, I sided with red, and this was met with approval. A few more people came in, some others left, but the real story I want to tell here is about how this man followed me home. It was late when I finally left, but it seemed much later. It seemed, in fact, like it should already be morning. It was a short walk to the hotel. As I gathered myself to go, Marcial pulled a few bills from his coat pocket and dropped them on the bar.</p><p>&ldquo;No tip?&rdquo; the bartender said. He was a dour man in his fifties, thin and balding, who had watched the entire soccer match without a sound, his hands folded neatly in his lap.</p><p>Marcial turned to me. &ldquo;This man is the owner. I can&rsquo;t tip him because it would be an insult. Tips are for workers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What logic,&rdquo; the owner said. &ldquo;There are other bars in town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But this one is special,&rdquo; Marcial said. He winked at me.</p><p>I paid and said my goodbyes. Marcial must have walked out right behind me, but a low, heavy fog had blown in, so I didn&rsquo;t notice him until I had reached the door of the hotel. He was ten paces back, shuffling up the hill. When he saw that I had seen him, he shrugged and, with great slowness, sat down on the curb, stretching his legs into the empty street. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not following you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just so you know. I&rsquo;ve come to look at the park.&rdquo;</p><p>Across the street, bathed in fog, there was indeed a tiny, manicured park, with regal stone benches and neatly trimmed rosebushes. Somehow I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it that morning. It seemed to have been dropped in from another country, an imitation of a postcard sent from far, far away.</p>











 <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not following you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just so you know. I&rsquo;ve come to look at the park.&rdquo;</p>






<p>&ldquo;There was a building there,&rdquo; Marcial said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a nice building. It was a dump. Full of Czechs and Russians, and the whole world knows they&rsquo;re slovenly people. But in the alley behind it&mdash;can you picture this?&mdash;where the wooden fence is now.&rdquo; He pointed. &ldquo;There&#33; I kissed my wife in that spot when we were seventeen. We scratched our names in the bricks with my switchblade. Of course, you had to carry a knife in those days, not like now.&rdquo; He said this last line in a tone of great disappointment. &ldquo;For example, you don&rsquo;t carry a knife, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.</p><p>Marcial took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lit one without offering. His white hair seemed to glow. &ldquo;I like your country,&rdquo; he said, though I hadn&rsquo;t told him where I was from. He blew smoke and stared into the street. &ldquo;Fine contraband. Interesting climate. Lovely, generous women.&rdquo;</p><p>This entire time I&rsquo;d been standing at the door of the hotel. I had the key in my hand and I could have left him at any moment.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re from the capital?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Born and raised.&rdquo;</p><p>Marcial sighed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a sadder, more detestable city in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am. Won&rsquo;t you sit?&rdquo;</p><p>It was, in spite of the damp, a warm night.</p><p>&ldquo;Why sugarcoat it?&rdquo; Marcial said, once I had joined him on the curb. &ldquo;I need money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He flicked what was left of his cigarette into the street. &ldquo;The port works all night, you know, twenty-four hours a day. It never closes. Everything brought into this cursed country comes through there. Have you read the papers? These are the good times&#33; So much work, and still they won&rsquo;t have me. Do you think I&rsquo;m old?&rdquo;</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>My grandfather was the oldest person I&rsquo;ve ever known. By the time I met Marcial he&rsquo;d been dead for three years. I told Marcial how my grandfather had kept a girlie calendar in his workshop, hidden from my grandmother behind a more respectable one with pictures of our country&rsquo;s various tourist attractions: those ruins with which we tempt the world. When I was a boy, he had me pencil in my birthday on the hidden calendar. Even then his memory was fading. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in May,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He held the calendar in his trembling hands and admired the woman. She was dark-skinned and leggy. My grandfather, I recall, held the calendar very close to his face; his eyes were no good. Then he passed it to me. &ldquo;Go ahead, write it. And your name too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The problem is that my birthday is in March,&rdquo; I told Marcial.</p><p>He smiled. &ldquo;But I forget things too.&rdquo;</p><p>A scruffy red-haired mutt appeared from under a park bench, padding lazily through the fog. He came right up to us, not growling, not afraid. Marcial took a wine cork from his pocket and held it out. The dog ventured closer, and licked the reddish end of the cork happily, like a lollipop. Marcial petted the dog with his other hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You really must see the port at night. It&rsquo;s something else,&rdquo; Marcial said. &ldquo;With all the lights, it looks like noon there. I can take you. I know the way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; I said. Of course every road in town led to the port, but it didn&rsquo;t seem right to tell him that.</p><p>He scowled. &ldquo;You people have no appreciation. It&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re so backward.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that, it was time to go. I was about to stand when Marcial stopped me. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, and I did. He shooed the dog away, as if he suddenly wanted privacy. He gave it a soft push, and when it resisted, he tossed the red wine cork down the street. The dog went off after it. He put his left hand on my shoulder, smiled, then showed me his right: it was a fist, and in it Marcial held a knife. It wasn&rsquo;t a long blade. He frowned. &ldquo;You see, I was hoping to rob you this evening.&rdquo;</p>











 <p>He frowned. &ldquo;You see, I was hoping to rob you this evening.&rdquo;</p>






<p>That night I dreamed of her and woke in a panic. The next night I was in a different hotel, in a different town farther down the coast&mdash;the same dream. By the fourth night, I had come to distrust myself, and was barely sleeping. I was thirsty all the time. I finished the book I&rsquo;d been reading and left it on the table at a coffee shop at a border town. I was halfway down the block when someone tapped me on the shoulder. It was the pretty waitress from the caf&eacute;. She was out of breath and there was a wonderful pink to her cheeks. &ldquo;You forgot your book,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;I left it on purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>She bit her lip. Somehow I&rsquo;d made her nervous. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>And so I took it with me. Five days later, I was home. I still hadn&rsquo;t slept, and it took the last of my strength to open the windows of the shuttered apartment. These were the abandoned rooms where I had been raised. The entire family had filtered north, then my wife and I came back to live out the last days of our marriage. There was hardly any furniture left&mdash;little by little our neighbors had raided the place. When my father first complained, we had attributed it to his dementia, but it turned out he was right. Now it had gotten out of control. The creaky chair where my wife and I had made love was gone. The sofa too had disappeared, and the wall clock, and the leather table in the foyer. I made a quick inventory: the china was missing, my mother&rsquo;s nice flatware, a silver picture frame, half the books. My grandfather&rsquo;s old tube radio was nowhere to be found and there was an dish towel moldering where the television had once sat.</p><p>But what did I care? I emptied my bag on the floor of the living room, shook its contents out, and observed with some satisfaction the accumulated mound of wrinkled clothes and paper and trinkets: train tickets, matchbooks, the knife I had taken from Marcial that night. The book was there too, adorned with its photograph of a Parisian woman with dark hair and dark eyes. It was summer and the setting sun poured in and stained the walls red. I could smell the ocean. Everyone knew I was back. I had sent postcards at every stop along the way, keeping the family apprised of my southern progress, and so I waited, watching the daylight fade, for someone to call. They were about to call; I was certain of it. There were, I assumed, still friends and family in this city of mine. I fell asleep on the wooden floor, waiting. When I awoke it was night, the apartment was dark and cool, and the phone hadn&rsquo;t disturbed my rest. I turned on every light in the old apartment and spent a furious half hour looking for it, tearing through what remained of our things, opening every drawer, every closet. The phone, the phone&mdash;our neighbors had taken it too. &#x25CF;</p>

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Julien Pacaud for BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;The town itself&#x3C;/b&#x3E; was interesting enough, with crumbling houses and narrow streets full of people who seemed not to know how to hurry. I learned to walk slowly and so this pace was not difficult for me. That day was absurdly sunny. In the afternoon I rode the one of the funiculars to the top of a hill, an outcropping of rock high above the sea where the wind blew so hard it forced my eyes shut and dusted my face with a fine film. From there, between gusts, I could see the port, its gleaming metal claws, its workers scurrying between acres of containers stacked one on top of the other. Beyond it was the ocean, a beautiful, roiling sheet of silver.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;Of course the real work of the day was pretending I wasn&#x26;rsquo;t lonely.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;Of course the real work of the day was pretending I wasn&#x26;rsquo;t lonely. By late afternoon I had given up, so I went to a bar down in the flats, a place that looked and smelled like the inside of a ship: the air was sooty and humid, the walls were held up by wooden beams curved like ribs. At any moment I thought they would give and the ocean would leak through, slowly at first, then with a deafening crash, and drown us all. There were five or six men at the bar. None sat together.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Nearly every inch of the place was covered with photographs: of politicians and starlets, soccer players and singers. The wall behind the bar was reserved for portraits of garlanded racehorses and their jockeys. I read for a bit, but the light was dim and I could barely make out the words. There was no music and very little conversation. The men nodded at the bartender, and drinks appeared before them in almost soundless transactions. I was there an hour before anyone said a word to me. It was an older gentleman in a worn navy sport coat. He said: &#x26;ldquo;You read so beautifully.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The way I felt in those days, it wouldn&#x26;rsquo;t have surprised me in the slightest to discover that I&#x26;rsquo;d been reading aloud. I blanched. &#x26;ldquo;How do you know?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You&#x26;rsquo;re so still.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Which struck me as funny. I&#x26;rsquo;d been traveling at that point for eight weeks and already the town was fading. The next day I would be heading south, relentlessly southward, and in ten days I would be home again for the first time in two years. But I suppose everything about me gave the impression of a wounded man, determined not to move. I had not spoken to my wife in many months. The effort it took not to think of her was so great that in the evenings my bones ached.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;I suppose everything about me gave the impression of a wounded man, determined not to move.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Cheers,&#x26;rdquo; I said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He told me his name was Marcial. &#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;m retired,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;rsquo;s wonderful.&#x26;rdquo; He paused, as if expecting me to respond, but I didn&#x26;rsquo;t. I must have glanced down at my book again. &#x26;ldquo;May I?&#x26;rdquo; he asked.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He was unshaven and had a tired look to him. His hair was completely, shockingly white. I passed him the book. It was all so tactile: he felt its texture, fanned its pages roughly, and smiled at the satisfying sound they made. He commented on the novel&#x26;rsquo;s weight. There was a woman on the cover, a stern, dark-haired beauty, looking down a Paris street. Or something like that. He ran his index finger over her face. &#x26;ldquo;She&#x26;rsquo;s pretty,&#x26;rdquo; he said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;We clinked glasses. &#x26;ldquo;I want you to understand my story,&#x26;rdquo; Marcial said. &#x26;ldquo;When my wife died, I told our children that I would drink for a year and then find a new woman.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was difficult to tell in the low light if he was a man at the beginning or the end of a yearlong bender. &#x26;ldquo;How is that working out?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;His beard was growing in white. He scratched the stubble. &#x26;ldquo;Very well,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;I have three months to go.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Eventually a television came on, and I pretended to read while Marcial followed a soccer match with muted enthusiasm. There was a red team and a blue team. When pressed, I sided with red, and this was met with approval. A few more people came in, some others left, but the real story I want to tell here is about how this man followed me home. It was late when I finally left, but it seemed much later. It seemed, in fact, like it should already be morning. It was a short walk to the hotel. As I gathered myself to go, Marcial pulled a few bills from his coat pocket and dropped them on the bar.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;No tip?&#x26;rdquo; the bartender said. He was a dour man in his fifties, thin and balding, who had watched the entire soccer match without a sound, his hands folded neatly in his lap.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Marcial turned to me. &#x26;ldquo;This man is the owner. I can&#x26;rsquo;t tip him because it would be an insult. Tips are for workers.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;What logic,&#x26;rdquo; the owner said. &#x26;ldquo;There are other bars in town.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;But this one is special,&#x26;rdquo; Marcial said. He winked at me.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I paid and said my goodbyes. Marcial must have walked out right behind me, but a low, heavy fog had blown in, so I didn&#x26;rsquo;t notice him until I had reached the door of the hotel. He was ten paces back, shuffling up the hill. When he saw that I had seen him, he shrugged and, with great slowness, sat down on the curb, stretching his legs into the empty street. &#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;m not following you,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;Just so you know. I&#x26;rsquo;ve come to look at the park.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Across the street, bathed in fog, there was indeed a tiny, manicured park, with regal stone benches and neatly trimmed rosebushes. Somehow I hadn&#x26;rsquo;t noticed it that morning. It seemed to have been dropped in from another country, an imitation of a postcard sent from far, far away.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;m not following you,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;Just so you know. I&#x26;rsquo;ve come to look at the park.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;There was a building there,&#x26;rdquo; Marcial said. &#x26;ldquo;It wasn&#x26;rsquo;t a nice building. It was a dump. Full of Czechs and Russians, and the whole world knows they&#x26;rsquo;re slovenly people. But in the alley behind it&#x26;mdash;can you picture this?&#x26;mdash;where the wooden fence is now.&#x26;rdquo; He pointed. &#x26;ldquo;There&#x26;#33; I kissed my wife in that spot when we were seventeen. We scratched our names in the bricks with my switchblade. Of course, you had to carry a knife in those days, not like now.&#x26;rdquo; He said this last line in a tone of great disappointment. &#x26;ldquo;For example, you don&#x26;rsquo;t carry a knife, do you?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;No,&#x26;rdquo; I said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Marcial took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lit one without offering. His white hair seemed to glow. &#x26;ldquo;I like your country,&#x26;rdquo; he said, though I hadn&#x26;rsquo;t told him where I was from. He blew smoke and stared into the street. &#x26;ldquo;Fine contraband. Interesting climate. Lovely, generous women.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;This entire time I&#x26;rsquo;d been standing at the door of the hotel. I had the key in my hand and I could have left him at any moment.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You&#x26;rsquo;re from the capital?&#x26;rdquo; he asked.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Born and raised.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Marcial sighed. &#x26;ldquo;There&#x26;rsquo;s not a sadder, more detestable city in the world.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You may be right,&#x26;rdquo; I said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Of course I am. Won&#x26;rsquo;t you sit?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was, in spite of the damp, a warm night.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Why sugarcoat it?&#x26;rdquo; Marcial said, once I had joined him on the curb. &#x26;ldquo;I need money.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I don&#x26;rsquo;t have money.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Don&#x26;rsquo;t you?&#x26;rdquo; He flicked what was left of his cigarette into the street. &#x26;ldquo;The port works all night, you know, twenty-four hours a day. It never closes. Everything brought into this cursed country comes through there. Have you read the papers? These are the good times&#x26;#33; So much work, and still they won&#x26;rsquo;t have me. Do you think I&#x26;rsquo;m old?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I shook my head.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;My grandfather was the oldest person I&#x26;rsquo;ve ever known. By the time I met Marcial he&#x26;rsquo;d been dead for three years. I told Marcial how my grandfather had kept a girlie calendar in his workshop, hidden from my grandmother behind a more respectable one with pictures of our country&#x26;rsquo;s various tourist attractions: those ruins with which we tempt the world. When I was a boy, he had me pencil in my birthday on the hidden calendar. Even then his memory was fading. &#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;rsquo;s in May,&#x26;rdquo; he said, &#x26;ldquo;isn&#x26;rsquo;t it?&#x26;rdquo; He held the calendar in his trembling hands and admired the woman. She was dark-skinned and leggy. My grandfather, I recall, held the calendar very close to his face; his eyes were no good. Then he passed it to me. &#x26;ldquo;Go ahead, write it. And your name too.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;The problem is that my birthday is in March,&#x26;rdquo; I told Marcial.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He smiled. &#x26;ldquo;But I forget things too.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;A scruffy red-haired mutt appeared from under a park bench, padding lazily through the fog. He came right up to us, not growling, not afraid. Marcial took a wine cork from his pocket and held it out. The dog ventured closer, and licked the reddish end of the cork happily, like a lollipop. Marcial petted the dog with his other hand.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You really must see the port at night. It&#x26;rsquo;s something else,&#x26;rdquo; Marcial said. &#x26;ldquo;With all the lights, it looks like noon there. I can take you. I know the way.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;No, thank you,&#x26;rdquo; I said. Of course every road in town led to the port, but it didn&#x26;rsquo;t seem right to tell him that.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He scowled. &#x26;ldquo;You people have no appreciation. It&#x26;rsquo;s why you&#x26;rsquo;re so backward.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;And with that, it was time to go. I was about to stand when Marcial stopped me. &#x26;ldquo;Wait,&#x26;rdquo; he said, and I did. He shooed the dog away, as if he suddenly wanted privacy. He gave it a soft push, and when it resisted, he tossed the red wine cork down the street. The dog went off after it. He put his left hand on my shoulder, smiled, then showed me his right: it was a fist, and in it Marcial held a knife. It wasn&#x26;rsquo;t a long blade. He frowned. &#x26;ldquo;You see, I was hoping to rob you this evening.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;He frowned. &#x26;ldquo;You see, I was hoping to rob you this evening.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;That night I dreamed of her and woke in a panic. The next night I was in a different hotel, in a different town farther down the coast&#x26;mdash;the same dream. By the fourth night, I had come to distrust myself, and was barely sleeping. I was thirsty all the time. I finished the book I&#x26;rsquo;d been reading and left it on the table at a coffee shop at a border town. I was halfway down the block when someone tapped me on the shoulder. It was the pretty waitress from the caf&#x26;eacute;. She was out of breath and there was a wonderful pink to her cheeks. &#x26;ldquo;You forgot your book,&#x26;rdquo; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I left it on purpose.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;She bit her lip. Somehow I&#x26;rsquo;d made her nervous. &#x26;ldquo;But you can&#x26;rsquo;t do that,&#x26;rdquo; she said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;And so I took it with me. Five days later, I was home. I still hadn&#x26;rsquo;t slept, and it took the last of my strength to open the windows of the shuttered apartment. These were the abandoned rooms where I had been raised. The entire family had filtered north, then my wife and I came back to live out the last days of our marriage. There was hardly any furniture left&#x26;mdash;little by little our neighbors had raided the place. When my father first complained, we had attributed it to his dementia, but it turned out he was right. Now it had gotten out of control. The creaky chair where my wife and I had made love was gone. The sofa too had disappeared, and the wall clock, and the leather table in the foyer. I made a quick inventory: the china was missing, my mother&#x26;rsquo;s nice flatware, a silver picture frame, half the books. My grandfather&#x26;rsquo;s old tube radio was nowhere to be found and there was an dish towel moldering where the television had once sat.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But what did I care? I emptied my bag on the floor of the living room, shook its contents out, and observed with some satisfaction the accumulated mound of wrinkled clothes and paper and trinkets: train tickets, matchbooks, the knife I had taken from Marcial that night. The book was there too, adorned with its photograph of a Parisian woman with dark hair and dark eyes. It was summer and the setting sun poured in and stained the walls red. I could smell the ocean. Everyone knew I was back. I had sent postcards at every stop along the way, keeping the family apprised of my southern progress, and so I waited, watching the daylight fade, for someone to call. They were about to call; I was certain of it. There were, I assumed, still friends and family in this city of mine. I fell asleep on the wooden floor, waiting. When I awoke it was night, the apartment was dark and cool, and the phone hadn&#x26;rsquo;t disturbed my rest. I turned on every light in the old apartment and spent a furious half hour looking for it, tearing through what remained of our things, opening every drawer, every closet. The phone, the phone&#x26;mdash;our neighbors had taken it too. &#x26;#x25CF;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>Why A 15-Year-Old Boy Is Fighting To Be Seen As A Hate Crime Victim</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/the-town-without-a-hate-crime?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>
<description><![CDATA[











 











 <p><b>Above:</b> Jason Gardner (center) is seen with his mother, La&#39;Kysha Gardner (left) and brother, Amari. La&#39;Kysha relays the news via Facebook Live that the alleged attacker&#39;s hearing was canceled a second time. </p>






<p>NEW HAVEN, Indiana &mdash; Jason Gardner first recounted the attack to police as he lay on a hospital bed shortly after midnight on June 6, 2017:</p><p>The 15-year-old was in the creek behind the Cedarwood Trails mobile home park in New Haven, Indiana, where he&rsquo;d lived since February. He was walking across the mud, calling out his girlfriend&rsquo;s name, when something hard hit the back of his head. He stumbled, and as he fell he turned and swung wildly, connecting with a cheek. But more blows rained down. Kicks struck his body as he curled up on the dirt. He couldn&rsquo;t see their faces in the darkness. Only their voices were clear.</p><p>&ldquo;Nigger&#33;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t belong here&#33;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go back to Africa where you came from&#33;&rdquo;</p><p>Jason wondered if he was about to die. He didn&rsquo;t remember how it ended. At some point, Jason said, he thought he blacked out. Next thing he knew, the beating was over and his rescuers were kneeling over him.</p><p>Police cars rushed to the park. Their lights and sirens, along with the shrieks of Jason&rsquo;s mother, drew neighbors outside. Soon, word of what had happened spread through the tight-knit community. Eventually a white teenager was charged with assault, and he now awaits trial in a case that has exposed the racism many locals have tried to ignore. Some in the community believe Jason&rsquo;s family exaggerated the role race played in the events before and after the attack. Many prefer not to talk about the incident at all.</p>

<p>Because Indiana is among the five states without a hate crime law, local investigators didn&rsquo;t have to determine whether the assault had been fueled by racism. The official record listed it merely as an act of battery, and an impressive streak lives on: According to law enforcement data, there has not been a single hate crime in the county since 2003.</p><p>During a year that has seen a surge in hate <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/once-you-create-that-place-for-hate-then-it-takes-off?utm_term=.qv0wEBjWm#.cg9Yom4rg">speech</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/the-hate-in-charlottesville-isnt-surprising-to-immigrants?utm_term=.mm7L45zDp#.gjZ8lNWOy">violence</a> across the country, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/kids-are-quoting-trump-to-bully-their-classmates?utm_term=.pkl4lwB1n#.id9VK9mzX">including</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/school-is-starting-soon-will-the-trump-inspired-bullying?utm_term=.xb7exJaEj#.ywkgDArq3">among</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/briannasacks/teens-at-these-high-schools-are-protesting-a-rise-in-racist?utm_term=.magw04Xbr#.dtJn1VlXm">children</a>, the attack on the teenager and its aftermath reflect the lengths local officials and residents go to avoid confronting the inconvenient, complicated, emotionally charged issue of racism.</p>











 <p>&ldquo;People were just denying the family&rsquo;s experience. They want to deny that there&rsquo;s a racism problem.&rdquo;</p>






<p>&ldquo;People were just denying the family&rsquo;s experience,&rdquo; said Nicki Meier, an organizer with the Center for Nonviolence in Fort Wayne, which borders New Haven. &ldquo;They want to deny that there&rsquo;s a racism problem.&rdquo;</p><p>To the Gardners, it was all too clear: A strain of terror that has coursed through the country&rsquo;s history had suddenly entered their household. The people they turned to for protection &mdash; their police department, their community &mdash; wanted their silence. For drawing attention to this reality, they have faced a backlash that drove them out of their home and out of the city.</p><p>Three days before the Gardners were set to speak at an Oct. 21 rally in support of hate crime legislation, Jason&rsquo;s mother received a Facebook message from an acquaintance who had heard from members of the suspect&rsquo;s family:</p><p>&ldquo;You might want to make sure you have a police presence on Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

 <p><small>Nick Hagen for BuzzFeed News</small></p>




<p><b>In August, after</b> a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent and resulted in a woman&rsquo;s death, state legislators in Indiana proposed a hate crime bill. Similar attempts have failed in recent years, as they have in Georgia, Arkansas, Wyoming, and South Carolina, which passed no law even in the wake of the Emanuel AME church massacre in 2015.<br /></p><p>But even in states that have these laws, hate crime convictions are rare. When there is not a burning cross left on the lawn or a swastika scrawled on the garage, prosecutors usually run up against the challenge of parsing an assailant&rsquo;s motivations. Many don&rsquo;t want to risk an otherwise solid case by throwing in racial considerations.</p><p>Locals officials often turn to the Department of Justice to build a hate crime case. But, from 2010 to 2015, federal prosecutors pursued charges in just 13% of the alleged hate crimes they reviewed, according to a Syracuse University <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/tracreports/crim/393/">study</a>. NAACP officials in Fort Wayne contacted the DOJ about the attack on Jason Gardner, but a DOJ spokesperson would not confirm to me whether or not they had opened an investigation into the case.</p>











 <p>Hate crime charges are less about prison time than about recognizing the existence of bias-fueled violence.</p>






<p>Hate crime charges don&rsquo;t often add significant time to a sentence. But these charges are less about prison time than about recognizing the existence of bias-fueled violence. The more hate crimes are missed, the more hidden the scope of hate in the US.</p><p>Though the Indiana State Police attempt to <a href="http://www.in.gov/isp/2654.htm">keep track</a> of the number of hate crimes in the state, the lack of a hate crime law allows local agencies to ignore the issue. Just 19 of Indiana&rsquo;s 535 police and sheriff&rsquo;s departments <a href="http://www.in.gov/isp/files/Bias_Crime_Report_2016.pdf">reported</a> a hate crime to state authorities in 2016. An Associated Press <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2016/06/05/most-indiana-agencies-dont-report-hate-crimes-fbi/85290262/">analysis</a> found that, from 2009 to 2014, fewer than half of the state&rsquo;s local agencies participated in the FBI&rsquo;s annual effort to document hate crimes &mdash; the fourth lowest rate of any state. The New Haven Police Department is among those who have filed no hate crime reports in recent years.</p><p>Chief Henry McKinnon told me that in his 22 years on the force he could not recall a single instance of racist violence in the city before the attack in the creek. Most of the dozen or so white Cedarwood Trails residents I spoke to couldn&rsquo;t remember any either.</p>

<p>If longtime locals haven&rsquo;t thought much about race, it might be because they&rsquo;ve been accustomed to living almost exclusively among white people. Only in recent years has the population of black residents begun to grow in the city of around 15,000. From 2000 to 2010, the number of black people living in New Haven jumped from 95 to nearly 500, according to Census data &mdash; a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/policing-and-race-in-troy-new-york?utm_term=.lw68oGb7n#.bkKEkj70P">pattern</a> mirrored in scores of suburbs and small cities in the US. The town&rsquo;s only public high school was 95% white as recently as 2003. Today, more than a quarter of its students are black.</p><p>The police department in New Haven is far less diverse: 19 of the 20 officers are white men; the sole woman, the first black member of the force, was hired in November 2016.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen any officer enforce the law based on anybody&rsquo;s sex, religion, culture, or color,&rdquo; McKinnon said. &ldquo;This incident aside, we&#39;ve always had a positive relationship with all the members of our community.&rdquo;</p><p>When I asked him in September if there&rsquo;s anything he would change about how the Jason Gardner case played out, he replied, &ldquo;As far as how we handled the investigation, I don&rsquo;t see anything I would change. I&rsquo;m proud of the guys and gals for the job they did.&rdquo;</p><p>Yet before Jason had even reached the hospital on the night of the attack, the department had lost the family&rsquo;s trust.</p>

<p><b>When the first</b> responding officer, Landon Sell, arrived at the creek, he made a radio call announcing that he saw a &ldquo;possible suspect&rdquo; leaving the scene: a black man in orange shorts.</p><p>It was Jason&rsquo;s 17-year-old brother, Amari, who was running home to alert the rest of their family about the attack. Chad Stahl, a neighbor, was with Amari. They were part of the small search party that had convened around 11 p.m., an hour after Jason was supposed to be back home for curfew. Two other neighbors in the group stayed in the creek with Jason, who they&rsquo;d found lying on his back, unmoving, his shirt ripped. In the police report he wrote two hours later, Officer Sell said that when he got to Jason, he asked if he&rsquo;d been attacked by a man fitting the possible suspect&rsquo;s description and Jason answered affirmatively. Both Jason and one of the neighbors present told me the officer never asked that.</p>











 <p>&ldquo;The officer didn&rsquo;t listen to me or Amari.&rdquo;</p>






<p>When the second responding officer, Greg Anderson, saw Amari &mdash; a young black man in orange shorts &mdash; and Stahl running through the neighborhood, he ordered them to stop, then handcuffed Amari but not Stahl, who is white.</p><p>&ldquo;I was trying to let the cops know that Jason was Amari&rsquo;s brother,&rdquo; Stahl said in a written statement for the court. &ldquo;The officer didn&rsquo;t listen to me or Amari.&rdquo;</p><p>Anderson&rsquo;s police report, which he wrote two hours later, didn&rsquo;t mention that a second person was with the black suspect he&rsquo;d detained. Chief McKinnon confirmed to me that a white companion had been present, but he defended Anderson&rsquo;s omission: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s focusing on the suspect,&rdquo; the chief said.</p><p>When Jason&rsquo;s mother, La&rsquo;Kysha, saw Amari inside a police car pulling up to the creek, she erupted in fury.</p><p>She got in Anderson&rsquo;s face, shouting that he was racist, that he had detained an innocent black teenager yet not the white man with him, that his department had done nothing to protect her family and had instead treated them like criminals. Her neighbor Heather Roberts-Smith pulled La&#39;Kysha away.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m white,&rdquo; she recalled saying to La&#39;Kysha. &ldquo;Let me talk to the police.&rdquo;</p><p>Within minutes, Amari was freed. Paramedics pulled his younger brother up the embankment on a backboard, then loaded him into an ambulance. In the hospital, as Jason told his story to a detective and an officer from the New Haven Police Department, the right side of his face was swollen, scratches cut across his chest, and at least one large bruise had formed on his torso.</p><p>He told police that he discerned three voices during the attack but recognized only one: It was a teenager named Lee, he said.</p>

<p><b>Jason had moved</b> into the trailer park just four months before the attack.</p><p>On the February morning when his mother, La&#39;Kysha, and her wife, Isolina Ball, drove through the subdivision for the first time, La&#39;Kysha observed that they might be the only black people in the neighborhood, a tree-lined pocket of 291 trailers sandwiched between the dusty lots of construction companies. When they stopped at the leasing office to sign the contract, they saw a Confederate flag hanging from a house down the street.</p><p>The Gardners had previously lived in Fort Wayne, in a mostly black neighborhood. They&rsquo;d relocated a few miles away, to this mostly white agricultural town with cheaper housing, intending to save for future college tuition payments for Jason and Amari. The Gardners quickly made friends, all of them white. Handsome and soft-spoken, Jason was popular among the girls at the trailer park. He dated one neighborhood girl until he found out she was lying about her age &mdash; claiming she was 15 when she was really 12.</p><p>Jason broke up with her. The next day, according to Jason, the girl&rsquo;s father, Cory, grabbed him and said his sons would beat him up for upsetting his daughter. Jason slipped away and told his family what happened, and soon a group of them went to Cory&rsquo;s lot to confront him.</p><p>It was the start of a dispute that continues today, the first in a series of incidents that brought police to the trailer park and forced neighbors to take sides as allegations of racism tore apart a community that white locals had considered welcoming to all.</p><p>As the families argued, insults flew. The four Gardners who were present claim Cory called Jason a "nigger." Cory&#39;s family declined interview requests, but in response to a Facebook message conveying the allegations in this story, his wife, Jennifer, told me: &ldquo;Cory does not want to talk about it. My family is not racist and I want people to stop bothering my family.&rdquo;</p><p>Isolina said she punched Cory in the jaw.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, neighbors said, relatives and friends of Cory&rsquo;s daughter walked up and down the Gardners&rsquo; street, carrying knives and staring at the trailer.</p><p>&ldquo;It definitely, to me, seemed like a racist thing,&rdquo; neighbor Heather Roberts-Smith said. &ldquo;These kids were coming down here to taunt them, to intimidate them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jason was talking to these white girls and they didn&rsquo;t like that down there,&rdquo; said Roberts-Smith&rsquo;s daughter, Danielle Hoffman, gesturing toward the southern end of the trailer park where some of the rival boys lived.</p><p>One of those boys was Lee. According to one of his classmates, a 15-year-old girl who lived across the street from the Gardners, Lee considered Cory his &ldquo;second family&rdquo; and announced that he planned to punish Jason for the scuffle.</p>











 <p>&ldquo;Jason was talking to these white girls and they didn&rsquo;t like that down there.&rdquo;</p>






<p>The girl passed along the messages, including Snapchat screenshots, to Jason&rsquo;s mother, who called police. The police chief said there wasn&#39;t anything he could do. In his experience, threats on the internet among teenagers were often empty, little more than a matter of kids being mean and dumb, and don&rsquo;t constitute a crime.</p><p>&ldquo;On a weekly basis we get reports of threats on social media,&rdquo; Chief McKinnon said.</p><p>Officer Amber Woodson noted in a police report that, in the weeks before the attack, she went to the Gardner residence &ldquo;a few times&rdquo; in response to calls. Woodson and other officers told the families to stay away from each other and suggested filing restraining orders if the problems continued. They stuck to this process even after Lee sent a Snapchat message to a friend on May 24 stating, &ldquo;I just wanna kill that little bastard jason gardener.&rdquo;</p><p>On the evening of June 5, Jason went to a friend&rsquo;s trailer to play basketball in the yard. On his bike ride home that night, Jason said, he happened to cross paths with Lee, who was with two friends Jason didn&rsquo;t recognize. To Jason&rsquo;s surprise, Lee was friendly and, in fact, had an urgent message: He&rsquo;d heard that Jason&rsquo;s current girlfriend was upset and had been seen walking toward the creek. Jason pedaled there as fast as he could.</p>

<p><b>When Detective Jeff McCracken and Officer Woodson</b> spoke with Lee a few hours after the attack, the boy told them that he&rsquo;d played basketball until around 9:30 p.m., gone home for dinner, then went to Cory&rsquo;s trailer to hang out with his teenage son. This account was different from what investigators heard from one of Lee&rsquo;s friends, a teenage neighbor who said that Lee came over to her trailer around 9 p.m., left at some point, then returned sometime after 11 p.m. In his report, McCracken stated that he told Lee that &ldquo;it seemed like he was not being completely honest.&rdquo; Lee agreed to take a lie detector test at the police station two days later but didn&rsquo;t show up. His parents didn&rsquo;t return officers&rsquo; calls.</p><p>Despite all this, it took more than two months to bring charges against Lee. McKinnon defends that time lapse.</p>

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Above:&#x3C;/b&#x3E; Jason Gardner (center) is seen with his mother, La&#x26;#39;Kysha Gardner (left) and brother, Amari. La&#x26;#39;Kysha relays the news via Facebook Live that the alleged attacker&#x26;#39;s hearing was canceled a second time. &#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;NEW HAVEN, Indiana &#x26;mdash; Jason Gardner first recounted the attack to police as he lay on a hospital bed shortly after midnight on June 6, 2017:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The 15-year-old was in the creek behind the Cedarwood Trails mobile home park in New Haven, Indiana, where he&#x26;rsquo;d lived since February. He was walking across the mud, calling out his girlfriend&#x26;rsquo;s name, when something hard hit the back of his head. He stumbled, and as he fell he turned and swung wildly, connecting with a cheek. But more blows rained down. Kicks struck his body as he curled up on the dirt. He couldn&#x26;rsquo;t see their faces in the darkness. Only their voices were clear.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Nigger&#x26;#33;&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You don&#x26;rsquo;t belong here&#x26;#33;&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Go back to Africa where you came from&#x26;#33;&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Jason wondered if he was about to die. He didn&#x26;rsquo;t remember how it ended. At some point, Jason said, he thought he blacked out. Next thing he knew, the beating was over and his rescuers were kneeling over him.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Police cars rushed to the park. Their lights and sirens, along with the shrieks of Jason&#x26;rsquo;s mother, drew neighbors outside. Soon, word of what had happened spread through the tight-knit community. Eventually a white teenager was charged with assault, and he now awaits trial in a case that has exposed the racism many locals have tried to ignore. Some in the community believe Jason&#x26;rsquo;s family exaggerated the role race played in the events before and after the attack. Many prefer not to talk about the incident at all.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Because Indiana is among the five states without a hate crime law, local investigators didn&#x26;rsquo;t have to determine whether the assault had been fueled by racism. The official record listed it merely as an act of battery, and an impressive streak lives on: According to law enforcement data, there has not been a single hate crime in the county since 2003.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;During a year that has seen a surge in hate &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/once-you-create-that-place-for-hate-then-it-takes-off?utm_term=.qv0wEBjWm#.cg9Yom4rg&#x22;&#x3E;speech&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/the-hate-in-charlottesville-isnt-surprising-to-immigrants?utm_term=.mm7L45zDp#.gjZ8lNWOy&#x22;&#x3E;violence&#x3C;/a&#x3E; across the country, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/kids-are-quoting-trump-to-bully-their-classmates?utm_term=.pkl4lwB1n#.id9VK9mzX&#x22;&#x3E;including&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/school-is-starting-soon-will-the-trump-inspired-bullying?utm_term=.xb7exJaEj#.ywkgDArq3&#x22;&#x3E;among&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/briannasacks/teens-at-these-high-schools-are-protesting-a-rise-in-racist?utm_term=.magw04Xbr#.dtJn1VlXm&#x22;&#x3E;children&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the attack on the teenager and its aftermath reflect the lengths local officials and residents go to avoid confronting the inconvenient, complicated, emotionally charged issue of racism.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;People were just denying the family&#x26;rsquo;s experience. They want to deny that there&#x26;rsquo;s a racism problem.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;People were just denying the family&#x26;rsquo;s experience,&#x26;rdquo; said Nicki Meier, an organizer with the Center for Nonviolence in Fort Wayne, which borders New Haven. &#x26;ldquo;They want to deny that there&#x26;rsquo;s a racism problem.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;To the Gardners, it was all too clear: A strain of terror that has coursed through the country&#x26;rsquo;s history had suddenly entered their household. The people they turned to for protection &#x26;mdash; their police department, their community &#x26;mdash; wanted their silence. For drawing attention to this reality, they have faced a backlash that drove them out of their home and out of the city.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Three days before the Gardners were set to speak at an Oct. 21 rally in support of hate crime legislation, Jason&#x26;rsquo;s mother received a Facebook message from an acquaintance who had heard from members of the suspect&#x26;rsquo;s family:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You might want to make sure you have a police presence on Saturday.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;In August, after&#x3C;/b&#x3E; a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent and resulted in a woman&#x26;rsquo;s death, state legislators in Indiana proposed a hate crime bill. Similar attempts have failed in recent years, as they have in Georgia, Arkansas, Wyoming, and South Carolina, which passed no law even in the wake of the Emanuel AME church massacre in 2015.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But even in states that have these laws, hate crime convictions are rare. When there is not a burning cross left on the lawn or a swastika scrawled on the garage, prosecutors usually run up against the challenge of parsing an assailant&#x26;rsquo;s motivations. Many don&#x26;rsquo;t want to risk an otherwise solid case by throwing in racial considerations.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Locals officials often turn to the Department of Justice to build a hate crime case. But, from 2010 to 2015, federal prosecutors pursued charges in just 13% of the alleged hate crimes they reviewed, according to a Syracuse University &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://trac.syr.edu/tracreports/crim/393/&#x22;&#x3E;study&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. NAACP officials in Fort Wayne contacted the DOJ about the attack on Jason Gardner, but a DOJ spokesperson would not confirm to me whether or not they had opened an investigation into the case.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;Hate crime charges are less about prison time than about recognizing the existence of bias-fueled violence.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hate crime charges don&#x26;rsquo;t often add significant time to a sentence. But these charges are less about prison time than about recognizing the existence of bias-fueled violence. The more hate crimes are missed, the more hidden the scope of hate in the US.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Though the Indiana State Police attempt to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.in.gov/isp/2654.htm&#x22;&#x3E;keep track&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the number of hate crimes in the state, the lack of a hate crime law allows local agencies to ignore the issue. Just 19 of Indiana&#x26;rsquo;s 535 police and sheriff&#x26;rsquo;s departments &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.in.gov/isp/files/Bias_Crime_Report_2016.pdf&#x22;&#x3E;reported&#x3C;/a&#x3E; a hate crime to state authorities in 2016. An Associated Press &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2016/06/05/most-indiana-agencies-dont-report-hate-crimes-fbi/85290262/&#x22;&#x3E;analysis&#x3C;/a&#x3E; found that, from 2009 to 2014, fewer than half of the state&#x26;rsquo;s local agencies participated in the FBI&#x26;rsquo;s annual effort to document hate crimes &#x26;mdash; the fourth lowest rate of any state. The New Haven Police Department is among those who have filed no hate crime reports in recent years.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Chief Henry McKinnon told me that in his 22 years on the force he could not recall a single instance of racist violence in the city before the attack in the creek. Most of the dozen or so white Cedarwood Trails residents I spoke to couldn&#x26;rsquo;t remember any either.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;If longtime locals haven&#x26;rsquo;t thought much about race, it might be because they&#x26;rsquo;ve been accustomed to living almost exclusively among white people. Only in recent years has the population of black residents begun to grow in the city of around 15,000. From 2000 to 2010, the number of black people living in New Haven jumped from 95 to nearly 500, according to Census data &#x26;mdash; a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/policing-and-race-in-troy-new-york?utm_term=.lw68oGb7n#.bkKEkj70P&#x22;&#x3E;pattern&#x3C;/a&#x3E; mirrored in scores of suburbs and small cities in the US. The town&#x26;rsquo;s only public high school was 95% white as recently as 2003. Today, more than a quarter of its students are black.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The police department in New Haven is far less diverse: 19 of the 20 officers are white men; the sole woman, the first black member of the force, was hired in November 2016.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;ve never seen any officer enforce the law based on anybody&#x26;rsquo;s sex, religion, culture, or color,&#x26;rdquo; McKinnon said. &#x26;ldquo;This incident aside, we&#x26;#39;ve always had a positive relationship with all the members of our community.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;When I asked him in September if there&#x26;rsquo;s anything he would change about how the Jason Gardner case played out, he replied, &#x26;ldquo;As far as how we handled the investigation, I don&#x26;rsquo;t see anything I would change. I&#x26;rsquo;m proud of the guys and gals for the job they did.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yet before Jason had even reached the hospital on the night of the attack, the department had lost the family&#x26;rsquo;s trust.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Nick Hagen for BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;When the first&#x3C;/b&#x3E; responding officer, Landon Sell, arrived at the creek, he made a radio call announcing that he saw a &#x26;ldquo;possible suspect&#x26;rdquo; leaving the scene: a black man in orange shorts.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was Jason&#x26;rsquo;s 17-year-old brother, Amari, who was running home to alert the rest of their family about the attack. Chad Stahl, a neighbor, was with Amari. They were part of the small search party that had convened around 11 p.m., an hour after Jason was supposed to be back home for curfew. Two other neighbors in the group stayed in the creek with Jason, who they&#x26;rsquo;d found lying on his back, unmoving, his shirt ripped. In the police report he wrote two hours later, Officer Sell said that when he got to Jason, he asked if he&#x26;rsquo;d been attacked by a man fitting the possible suspect&#x26;rsquo;s description and Jason answered affirmatively. Both Jason and one of the neighbors present told me the officer never asked that.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;The officer didn&#x26;rsquo;t listen to me or Amari.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;When the second responding officer, Greg Anderson, saw Amari &#x26;mdash; a young black man in orange shorts &#x26;mdash; and Stahl running through the neighborhood, he ordered them to stop, then handcuffed Amari but not Stahl, who is white.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I was trying to let the cops know that Jason was Amari&#x26;rsquo;s brother,&#x26;rdquo; Stahl said in a written statement for the court. &#x26;ldquo;The officer didn&#x26;rsquo;t listen to me or Amari.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anderson&#x26;rsquo;s police report, which he wrote two hours later, didn&#x26;rsquo;t mention that a second person was with the black suspect he&#x26;rsquo;d detained. Chief McKinnon confirmed to me that a white companion had been present, but he defended Anderson&#x26;rsquo;s omission: &#x26;ldquo;He&#x26;rsquo;s focusing on the suspect,&#x26;rdquo; the chief said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;When Jason&#x26;rsquo;s mother, La&#x26;rsquo;Kysha, saw Amari inside a police car pulling up to the creek, she erupted in fury.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;She got in Anderson&#x26;rsquo;s face, shouting that he was racist, that he had detained an innocent black teenager yet not the white man with him, that his department had done nothing to protect her family and had instead treated them like criminals. Her neighbor Heather Roberts-Smith pulled La&#x26;#39;Kysha away.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;m white,&#x26;rdquo; she recalled saying to La&#x26;#39;Kysha. &#x26;ldquo;Let me talk to the police.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Within minutes, Amari was freed. Paramedics pulled his younger brother up the embankment on a backboard, then loaded him into an ambulance. In the hospital, as Jason told his story to a detective and an officer from the New Haven Police Department, the right side of his face was swollen, scratches cut across his chest, and at least one large bruise had formed on his torso.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He told police that he discerned three voices during the attack but recognized only one: It was a teenager named Lee, he said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Jason had moved&#x3C;/b&#x3E; into the trailer park just four months before the attack.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the February morning when his mother, La&#x26;#39;Kysha, and her wife, Isolina Ball, drove through the subdivision for the first time, La&#x26;#39;Kysha observed that they might be the only black people in the neighborhood, a tree-lined pocket of 291 trailers sandwiched between the dusty lots of construction companies. When they stopped at the leasing office to sign the contract, they saw a Confederate flag hanging from a house down the street.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The Gardners had previously lived in Fort Wayne, in a mostly black neighborhood. They&#x26;rsquo;d relocated a few miles away, to this mostly white agricultural town with cheaper housing, intending to save for future college tuition payments for Jason and Amari. The Gardners quickly made friends, all of them white. Handsome and soft-spoken, Jason was popular among the girls at the trailer park. He dated one neighborhood girl until he found out she was lying about her age &#x26;mdash; claiming she was 15 when she was really 12.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Jason broke up with her. The next day, according to Jason, the girl&#x26;rsquo;s father, Cory, grabbed him and said his sons would beat him up for upsetting his daughter. Jason slipped away and told his family what happened, and soon a group of them went to Cory&#x26;rsquo;s lot to confront him.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was the start of a dispute that continues today, the first in a series of incidents that brought police to the trailer park and forced neighbors to take sides as allegations of racism tore apart a community that white locals had considered welcoming to all.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;As the families argued, insults flew. The four Gardners who were present claim Cory called Jason a &#x22;nigger.&#x22; Cory&#x26;#39;s family declined interview requests, but in response to a Facebook message conveying the allegations in this story, his wife, Jennifer, told me: &#x26;ldquo;Cory does not want to talk about it. My family is not racist and I want people to stop bothering my family.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Isolina said she punched Cory in the jaw.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Over the next few weeks, neighbors said, relatives and friends of Cory&#x26;rsquo;s daughter walked up and down the Gardners&#x26;rsquo; street, carrying knives and staring at the trailer.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;It definitely, to me, seemed like a racist thing,&#x26;rdquo; neighbor Heather Roberts-Smith said. &#x26;ldquo;These kids were coming down here to taunt them, to intimidate them.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Jason was talking to these white girls and they didn&#x26;rsquo;t like that down there,&#x26;rdquo; said Roberts-Smith&#x26;rsquo;s daughter, Danielle Hoffman, gesturing toward the southern end of the trailer park where some of the rival boys lived.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;One of those boys was Lee. According to one of his classmates, a 15-year-old girl who lived across the street from the Gardners, Lee considered Cory his &#x26;ldquo;second family&#x26;rdquo; and announced that he planned to punish Jason for the scuffle.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Jason was talking to these white girls and they didn&#x26;rsquo;t like that down there.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;The girl passed along the messages, including Snapchat screenshots, to Jason&#x26;rsquo;s mother, who called police. The police chief said there wasn&#x26;#39;t anything he could do. In his experience, threats on the internet among teenagers were often empty, little more than a matter of kids being mean and dumb, and don&#x26;rsquo;t constitute a crime.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;On a weekly basis we get reports of threats on social media,&#x26;rdquo; Chief McKinnon said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Officer Amber Woodson noted in a police report that, in the weeks before the attack, she went to the Gardner residence &#x26;ldquo;a few times&#x26;rdquo; in response to calls. Woodson and other officers told the families to stay away from each other and suggested filing restraining orders if the problems continued. They stuck to this process even after Lee sent a Snapchat message to a friend on May 24 stating, &#x26;ldquo;I just wanna kill that little bastard jason gardener.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the evening of June 5, Jason went to a friend&#x26;rsquo;s trailer to play basketball in the yard. On his bike ride home that night, Jason said, he happened to cross paths with Lee, who was with two friends Jason didn&#x26;rsquo;t recognize. To Jason&#x26;rsquo;s surprise, Lee was friendly and, in fact, had an urgent message: He&#x26;rsquo;d heard that Jason&#x26;rsquo;s current girlfriend was upset and had been seen walking toward the creek. Jason pedaled there as fast as he could.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Nick Hagen for BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;When Detective Jeff McCracken and Officer Woodson&#x3C;/b&#x3E; spoke with Lee a few hours after the attack, the boy told them that he&#x26;rsquo;d played basketball until around 9:30 p.m., gone home for dinner, then went to Cory&#x26;rsquo;s trailer to hang out with his teenage son. This account was different from what investigators heard from one of Lee&#x26;rsquo;s friends, a teenage neighbor who said that Lee came over to her trailer around 9 p.m., left at some point, then returned sometime after 11 p.m. In his report, McCracken stated that he told Lee that &#x26;ldquo;it seemed like he was not being completely honest.&#x26;rdquo; Lee agreed to take a lie detector test at the police station two days later but didn&#x26;rsquo;t show up. His parents didn&#x26;rsquo;t return officers&#x26;rsquo; calls.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Despite all this, it took more than two months to bring charges against Lee. McKinnon defends that time lapse.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;Growing impatient and skeptical of the department&#x26;rsquo;s efforts, La&#x26;#39;Kysha contacted the president of the local NAACP chapter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p><b>Last week, when</b> the singer Bj&ouml;rk effectively <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bjork-details-danish-directors-sexual-harassment-toward-her-w509026">accused the director Lars von Trier</a> of sexual harassment, it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a surprise to anyone who&rsquo;s been following his career. Bj&ouml;rk&rsquo;s ordeal on the set of <i>Dancer in the Dark</i> (in a role that earned her a Best Actress Award at Cannes) was already partially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/25/film-maker-directors-clint-eastwood-tom-hanks-intimidating-as-hell-sully">known</a>, and von Trier has long cultivated an image of arrogance and uncompromising dominance in filmmaking; he <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lars-von-trier-denies-sexually-harassing-bjork-1049045">denies harassing Bj&ouml;rk</a>, but does not deny that their relationship was fraught. He also seems obsessed with, as movie critic Dana Stevens <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2009/10/game_over.html">wrote in Slate</a> in 2009, making movies &ldquo;in which a passive, vulnerable, often mentally unstable woman is gradually driven crazy, and sometimes killed.&rdquo; He once <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/11/06/142026288/lars-von-trier-a-problematic-sort-of-ladies-man">said in an interview</a>, in regard to his reputation, &ldquo;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve misused anybody, but I could, of course. And I could be tempted to."</p><p>Von Trier is also considered by many to be one of the best film directors in the world. He has been awarded the Palme D&rsquo;Or, the Grand Prix, and the Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival. He consistently works with some of the top actors in the industry, from Nicole Kidman to Kirsten Dunst, and was a cofounder of an influential minimalist film movement called Dogme 95. Although one of that movement&rsquo;s rules was that &ldquo;the director must not be credited,&rdquo; it has always been hard to separate the man himself from any of his award-winning works. This is often attributed to his unique <a href="https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-natural-lars-von-trier-on-dogville-2928/">cinematic talents</a>, but as the Guardian noted in 2012 &mdash; while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/01/best-film-directors-world-2012">naming him</a> one of the greatest living directors &mdash; von Trier is as known for his &ldquo;juvenile love of provocation&rdquo; as he is for his artistic impact.</p>

<p>Von Trier&rsquo;s directing style has <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/11/06/142026288/lars-von-trier-a-problematic-sort-of-ladies-man">been described</a> as &ldquo;a gift and a curse&rdquo; to the women who star in his films, for the fact that it can result in major acting awards. But in 2011, Bj&ouml;rk challenged the idea that the performances of women in his films were evidence of von Trier&rsquo;s artistry, <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/lars-von-trier-gq-interview-bjork-john-c-reilly-kirsten-dunst-nicole-kidman-extras">asserting instead</a> that &ldquo;he needs a female to provide his work soul. And he envies them and hates them for it. So he has to destroy them during the filming. And hide the evidence.&rdquo;</p><p>Like some other male directors in Hollywood (think of Quentin Tarantino defending his <a href="http://gawker.com/twenty-years-of-quentin-tarantino-characters-saying-ni-1749615898?utm_campaign=socialflow_gawker_twitter&amp;utm_source=gawker_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">use of the &ldquo;n-word&rdquo;</a> or Gasper No&eacute; <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/why-gaspar-noe-directed-on-cocaine-masturbated-in-his-own-film-and-shot-a-live-birth-55975/">bragging</a> about shooting a film while high on cocaine), von Trier courts controversy and successfully promotes the idea that his wild, transgressive imagination is worth all the terribly &ldquo;juvenile&rdquo; things he might do while exploring it. But he hasn&rsquo;t been ostracized in the industry for jokes about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/18/lars-von-trier-cannes-2011-nazi-comments">sympathizing with Hitler</a>, or his legacy of <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2014/03/four-directors-who-torture-their-actors-from-hitch-to-trier-clips-193030/">pushing women past their limits</a> on set. Each story of von Trier&rsquo;s offensive or oppressive behavior over the years has just seemed to contribute to the perception that he is some kind of demented visionary with, as MovieMaker magazine <a href="https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-natural-lars-von-trier-on-dogville-2928/">puts it</a>, a &ldquo;playful instinct to provoke and experiment.&rdquo;</p><p>The line between provocateur and abuser remains very much blurred in the culture of film at large, and certainly in how we talk about directing movies. And producers, critics, and audiences have not just watched but applauded over the decades as men who direct cross over it again and again. More often than not, in an industry dominated by men who worship other men, those behind the camera who &ldquo;provoke&rdquo; the women they work with &mdash; from <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/29/alfred-hitchcock-a-sadistic-prankster/">Alfred Hitchcock</a> to <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/flashback-shelley-duvall-battles-stanley-kubrick-w450947">Stanley Kubrick</a> to <a href="http://www.pajiba.com/film_reviews/hey-hollywood-dont-forget-david-o-russell-is-an-abusive-jerk.php">David O. Russell</a> &mdash; are given the benefit of the doubt over the women who suffer under that so-called provocation, or at least the blessing of endless <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2011/01/qa-david-o-russell">second chances</a>.</p>

<p>In many of these cases, the alleged abuse is emotional or verbal, rather than sexual. But in the wake of the tide of <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/harvey-weinstein-sexual-misconduct-allegations?utm_term=.dckAWEed8#.sr7ydZ32r">allegations</a> against producer Harvey Weinstein, now followed by Bj&ouml;rk&rsquo;s implied statement on von Trier and the staggering number of women (more than 200) who have <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/james-toback-sexual-harassment-200-women-los-angeles-times-1201890416/">accused</a> director James Toback of harassment, there is a new and substantial pressure on those in power in Hollywood to broadly transform the culture of filmmaking. There are some signs that Weinstein&rsquo;s downfall might already be <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/roy-price-resigns-as-amazon-studios-head-1049728">impacting</a> the dominance of white men in the industry. And if disrupting the status quo is the goal, it&rsquo;s past time for cinema&rsquo;s elite to explore how the deification of men who direct might itself be contributing to an environment ripe for abuse.</p><p>After all, not everyone gets to be a provocateur, or a &ldquo;juvenile&rdquo; genius, on a film set. And the long leash men specifically receive for their &ldquo;risky&rdquo; artistic exploration has too often shown a tendency to morph into a cosigning of the exploitation of power. In fact, in the one-sided history of cinema, so many directors who abuse women in one way or another have been able to find repeated success and acclaim that abuse is not just systematically overlooked &mdash; it is often treated as a sign of a man&rsquo;s genius.</p>











 





<p><b>The dominance of white men</b> is the centuries-long story of the world we live in, and the movies have long played a role in celebrating and maintaining patriarchy. For nearly 100 years, Americans have gone to the cinema, sat in the darkness beneath a massive screen, and stared up at the dreams of men.</p><p>Laura Mulvey wrote about cinema&rsquo;s &ldquo;male gaze&rdquo; in her influential 1973 essay &ldquo;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,&rdquo; and feminist theorists of color like bell hooks have been <a href="https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/pg/masters/modules/femlit/bell_hooks.pdf">expanding</a> on similar ideas for decades, but it&rsquo;s clear that much of the industry <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/the-lost-generation-of-female-directors?utm_term=.nkYK1P8wJ#.uaO2vrg9L">never got the memos</a> &mdash; or chose not to read them. Because even if women have been included a (wee) bit more behind the camera in 2017, the cinematic perspective of straight white men is still largely considered the <i>better</i> one in Hollywood and beyond &mdash; the more artistic and more meaningful lens through which to see the world.<br /></p><p>For instance, men directed 21 of the New York Times&rsquo; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/09/movies/the-25-best-films-of-the-21st-century.html">&ldquo;25 Best Films of the 21st Century So Far</a>.&rdquo; All of the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/21/top-10-arthouse-movies">Top Arthouse movies</a>&rdquo; in a 2013 list at the Guardian were directed by men, and Taste of Cinema&rsquo;s 2014 <a href="http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2014/10-most-innovative-filmmakers-working-today/">list</a> of &ldquo;the most innovative filmmakers working today&rdquo; is all men too. Only two (white) women have ever won Best Director at Cannes in its 71-year history, and only one (white) woman has ever won Best Director at the Oscars. But it&rsquo;s not just who gets recognized as &ldquo;great&rdquo; that bears out a gender bias, but how the mainstream language around directing film remains centered on expressions of masculinity as well.<br /></p>

<p>The same year that Mulvey published her landmark work, the Oscar-winning director Elia Kazan (who made <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> and <i>On the Waterfront</i>) gave a speech at Wesleyan University titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dga.org/~/media/Files/TheGuild/Committees/Kazan.ashx">What Makes a Director</a>.&rdquo; He begins by asking three rhetorical questions: &ldquo;How must he educate himself? Of what skills is his craft made? What kind of man must he be?&rdquo; He goes on to give the assembled students a litany of advice, including the eyebrow-raising suggestion that a man who directs &ldquo;must be an authority&rdquo; on &ldquo;lovemaking.&rdquo;</p><p>Kazan&rsquo;s assertion that filmmaking requires masculinity and is itself an expression of worldly manhood has more or less remained the accepted norm to this day in Hollywood, despite the best efforts of feminists and women behind the camera to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/blessed-be-the-fruit?utm_term=.kfXZ2lxGX#.edZ392zRK">open our eyes</a> to how narrow that masculine perspective really is. It reflects not only the persistence of &ldquo;auteur theory,&rdquo; the popular idea that directors are the true &ldquo;authors&rdquo; of film &mdash; which first elevated men like Hitchcock and Howard Hawks to the level of respected artists &mdash; but the broader concept that greatness in cinema is necessarily tied to <i>dominance</i> over a film&rsquo;s production.</p><p>Bernardo Bertolucci, a two-time Academy Award winner, embodied this mentality when he <a href="http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a41202/bertolucci-last-tango-in-paris-rape-scene-non-consensual/">confessed</a> to directing a rape scene in 1972&rsquo;s Last Tango in Paris without the full consent of star Maria Schneider. Schneider, who appeared opposite Marlon Brando, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-469646/I-felt-raped-Brando.html">said</a> in 2007 that although the assault in the film was simulated, &ldquo;I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped.&rdquo; The Italian director had no qualms about <a href="http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a41202/bertolucci-last-tango-in-paris-rape-scene-non-consensual/">sharing</a> in 2016 that he intentionally withheld information about the scene in order to remain in complete control: "I didn&#39;t want Maria to act her humiliation her rage, I wanted her &hellip; to feel &hellip; the rage and humiliation.&rdquo;<br /></p>

<p>Men aren&rsquo;t just given the <a href="http://variety.com/2017/film/news/female-directors-hollywood-diversity-1201958694/">majority of opportunities</a> in cinema, but are rewarded for making films in a way that reinforces their power and control in society, which we see in the way authoritarian filmmaking itself is glorified. Whether it&rsquo;s the famously <a href="http://www.deathbyfilms.com/hell-on-earth-the-making-of-apocalypse-now">warlike</a> atmosphere of Francis Ford Coppola&rsquo;s <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, or the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/did-a-director-push-too-far">unbearable conditions</a>&rdquo; reported by the actors of the Palme D&rsquo;Or&ndash;winning <i>Blue Is the Warmest Color</i>, many of the most highly praised films are those that display, in their &ldquo;craft,&rdquo; an adherence to hypermasculine ideals of power. And if the popular idea of directing remains primarily about precision, control, and masculinity, then it should be no surprise that it often manifests as expressions of power over women &mdash; which often inflict real and lasting damage.<br /></p>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Last week, when&#x3C;/b&#x3E; the singer Bj&#x26;ouml;rk effectively &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bjork-details-danish-directors-sexual-harassment-toward-her-w509026&#x22;&#x3E;accused the director Lars von Trier&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of sexual harassment, it wasn&#x26;rsquo;t necessarily a surprise to anyone who&#x26;rsquo;s been following his career. Bj&#x26;ouml;rk&#x26;rsquo;s ordeal on the set of &#x3C;i&#x3E;Dancer in the Dark&#x3C;/i&#x3E; (in a role that earned her a Best Actress Award at Cannes) was already partially &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/25/film-maker-directors-clint-eastwood-tom-hanks-intimidating-as-hell-sully&#x22;&#x3E;known&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and von Trier has long cultivated an image of arrogance and uncompromising dominance in filmmaking; he &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lars-von-trier-denies-sexually-harassing-bjork-1049045&#x22;&#x3E;denies harassing Bj&#x26;ouml;rk&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but does not deny that their relationship was fraught. He also seems obsessed with, as movie critic Dana Stevens &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2009/10/game_over.html&#x22;&#x3E;wrote in Slate&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in 2009, making movies &#x26;ldquo;in which a passive, vulnerable, often mentally unstable woman is gradually driven crazy, and sometimes killed.&#x26;rdquo; He once &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.npr.org/2011/11/06/142026288/lars-von-trier-a-problematic-sort-of-ladies-man&#x22;&#x3E;said in an interview&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, in regard to his reputation, &#x26;ldquo;I don&#x26;#39;t think I&#x26;#39;ve misused anybody, but I could, of course. And I could be tempted to.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Von Trier is also considered by many to be one of the best film directors in the world. He has been awarded the Palme D&#x26;rsquo;Or, the Grand Prix, and the Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival. He consistently works with some of the top actors in the industry, from Nicole Kidman to Kirsten Dunst, and was a cofounder of an influential minimalist film movement called Dogme 95. Although one of that movement&#x26;rsquo;s rules was that &#x26;ldquo;the director must not be credited,&#x26;rdquo; it has always been hard to separate the man himself from any of his award-winning works. This is often attributed to his unique &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-natural-lars-von-trier-on-dogville-2928/&#x22;&#x3E;cinematic talents&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but as the Guardian noted in 2012 &#x26;mdash; while &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/01/best-film-directors-world-2012&#x22;&#x3E;naming him&#x3C;/a&#x3E; one of the greatest living directors &#x26;mdash; von Trier is as known for his &#x26;ldquo;juvenile love of provocation&#x26;rdquo; as he is for his artistic impact.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Von Trier&#x26;rsquo;s directing style has &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.npr.org/2011/11/06/142026288/lars-von-trier-a-problematic-sort-of-ladies-man&#x22;&#x3E;been described&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as &#x26;ldquo;a gift and a curse&#x26;rdquo; to the women who star in his films, for the fact that it can result in major acting awards. But in 2011, Bj&#x26;ouml;rk challenged the idea that the performances of women in his films were evidence of von Trier&#x26;rsquo;s artistry, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.gq.com/story/lars-von-trier-gq-interview-bjork-john-c-reilly-kirsten-dunst-nicole-kidman-extras&#x22;&#x3E;asserting instead&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that &#x26;ldquo;he needs a female to provide his work soul. And he envies them and hates them for it. So he has to destroy them during the filming. And hide the evidence.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Like some other male directors in Hollywood (think of Quentin Tarantino defending his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://gawker.com/twenty-years-of-quentin-tarantino-characters-saying-ni-1749615898?utm_campaign=socialflow_gawker_twitter&#x26;amp;utm_source=gawker_twitter&#x26;amp;utm_medium=socialflow&#x22;&#x3E;use of the &#x26;ldquo;n-word&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or Gasper No&#x26;eacute; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/why-gaspar-noe-directed-on-cocaine-masturbated-in-his-own-film-and-shot-a-live-birth-55975/&#x22;&#x3E;bragging&#x3C;/a&#x3E; about shooting a film while high on cocaine), von Trier courts controversy and successfully promotes the idea that his wild, transgressive imagination is worth all the terribly &#x26;ldquo;juvenile&#x26;rdquo; things he might do while exploring it. But he hasn&#x26;rsquo;t been ostracized in the industry for jokes about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/18/lars-von-trier-cannes-2011-nazi-comments&#x22;&#x3E;sympathizing with Hitler&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, or his legacy of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.indiewire.com/2014/03/four-directors-who-torture-their-actors-from-hitch-to-trier-clips-193030/&#x22;&#x3E;pushing women past their limits&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on set. Each story of von Trier&#x26;rsquo;s offensive or oppressive behavior over the years has just seemed to contribute to the perception that he is some kind of demented visionary with, as MovieMaker magazine &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-natural-lars-von-trier-on-dogville-2928/&#x22;&#x3E;puts it&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, a &#x26;ldquo;playful instinct to provoke and experiment.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The line between provocateur and abuser remains very much blurred in the culture of film at large, and certainly in how we talk about directing movies. And producers, critics, and audiences have not just watched but applauded over the decades as men who direct cross over it again and again. More often than not, in an industry dominated by men who worship other men, those behind the camera who &#x26;ldquo;provoke&#x26;rdquo; the women they work with &#x26;mdash; from &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/29/alfred-hitchcock-a-sadistic-prankster/&#x22;&#x3E;Alfred Hitchcock&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/flashback-shelley-duvall-battles-stanley-kubrick-w450947&#x22;&#x3E;Stanley Kubrick&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.pajiba.com/film_reviews/hey-hollywood-dont-forget-david-o-russell-is-an-abusive-jerk.php&#x22;&#x3E;David O.

&#x3C;p&#x3E;In many of these cases, the alleged abuse is emotional or verbal, rather than sexual. But in the wake of the tide of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/harvey-weinstein-sexual-misconduct-allegations?utm_term=.dckAWEed8#.sr7ydZ32r&#x22;&#x3E;allegations&#x3C;/a&#x3E; against producer Harvey Weinstein, now followed by Bj&#x26;ouml;rk&#x26;rsquo;s implied statement on von Trier and the staggering number of women (more than 200) who have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/james-toback-sexual-harassment-200-women-los-angeles-times-1201890416/&#x22;&#x3E;accused&#x3C;/a&#x3E; director James Toback of harassment, there is a new and substantial pressure on those in power in Hollywood to broadly transform the culture of filmmaking. There are some signs that Weinstein&#x26;rsquo;s downfall might already be &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/roy-price-resigns-as-amazon-studios-head-1049728&#x22;&#x3E;impacting&#x3C;/a&#x3E; the dominance of white men in the industry. And if disrupting the status quo is the goal, it&#x26;rsquo;s past time for cinema&#x26;rsquo;s elite to explore how the deification of men who direct might itself be contributing to an environment ripe for abuse.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;After all, not everyone gets to be a provocateur, or a &#x26;ldquo;juvenile&#x26;rdquo; genius, on a film set. And the long leash men specifically receive for their &#x26;ldquo;risky&#x26;rdquo; artistic exploration has too often shown a tendency to morph into a cosigning of the exploitation of power. In fact, in the one-sided history of cinema, so many directors who abuse women in one way or another have been able to find repeated success and acclaim that abuse is not just systematically overlooked &#x26;mdash; it is often treated as a sign of a man&#x26;rsquo;s genius.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

Of what skills is his craft made? What kind of man must he be?&#x26;rdquo; He goes on to give the assembled students a litany of advice, including the eyebrow-raising suggestion that a man who directs &#x26;ldquo;must be an authority&#x26;rdquo; on &#x26;ldquo;lovemaking.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kazan&#x26;rsquo;s assertion that filmmaking requires masculinity and is itself an expression of worldly manhood has more or less remained the accepted norm to this day in Hollywood, despite the best efforts of feminists and women behind the camera to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/blessed-be-the-fruit?utm_term=.kfXZ2lxGX#.edZ392zRK&#x22;&#x3E;open our eyes&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to how narrow that masculine perspective really is. It reflects not only the persistence of &#x26;ldquo;auteur theory,&#x26;rdquo; the popular idea that directors are the true &#x26;ldquo;authors&#x26;rdquo; of film &#x26;mdash; which first elevated men like Hitchcock and Howard Hawks to the level of respected artists &#x26;mdash; but the broader concept that greatness in cinema is necessarily tied to &#x3C;i&#x3E;dominance&#x3C;/i&#x3E; over a film&#x26;rsquo;s production.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Bernardo Bertolucci, a two-time Academy Award winner, embodied this mentality when he &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a41202/bertolucci-last-tango-in-paris-rape-scene-non-consensual/&#x22;&#x3E;confessed&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to directing a rape scene in 1972&#x26;rsquo;s Last Tango in Paris without the full consent of star Maria Schneider. Schneider, who appeared opposite Marlon Brando, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-469646/I-felt-raped-Brando.html&#x22;&#x3E;said&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in 2007 that although the assault in the film was simulated, &#x26;ldquo;I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped.&#x26;rdquo; The Italian director had no qualms about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a41202/bertolucci-last-tango-in-paris-rape-scene-non-consensual/&#x22;&#x3E;sharing&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in 2016 that he intentionally withheld information about the scene in order to remain in complete control: &#x22;I didn&#x26;#39;t want Maria to act her humiliation her rage, I wanted her &#x26;hellip; to feel &#x26;hellip; the rage and humiliation.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Men aren&#x26;rsquo;t just given the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://variety.com/2017/film/news/female-directors-hollywood-diversity-1201958694/&#x22;&#x3E;majority of opportunities&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in cinema, but are rewarded for making films in a way that reinforces their power and control in society, which we see in the way authoritarian filmmaking itself is glorified. Whether it&#x26;rsquo;s the famously &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.deathbyfilms.com/hell-on-earth-the-making-of-apocalypse-now&#x22;&#x3E;warlike&#x3C;/a&#x3E; atmosphere of Francis Ford Coppola&#x26;rsquo;s &#x3C;i&#x3E;Apocalypse Now&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, or the &#x26;ldquo;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/did-a-director-push-too-far&#x22;&#x3E;unbearable conditions&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x26;rdquo; reported by the actors of the Palme D&#x26;rsquo;Or&#x26;ndash;winning &#x3C;i&#x3E;Blue Is the Warmest Color&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, many of the most highly praised films are those that display, in their &#x26;ldquo;craft,&#x26;rdquo; an adherence to hypermasculine ideals of power. And if the popular idea of directing remains primarily about precision, control, and masculinity, then it should be no surprise that it often manifests as expressions of power over women &#x26;mdash; which often inflict real and lasting damage.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p><b>Ten miles south</b> of Whitefish, Montana, a paved road turns into gravel, before turning into forest. On one side, there&rsquo;s a small horse farm. On the other, signs read &ldquo;Private Property&rdquo; and suggest the area is being patrolled in order to prevent poaching. At the end of a long private drive lined with towering pines, an RV is parked on the grass in front of a log and stone cabin. This is the home of Whitefish Energy, a tiny company that has been awarded a contract valued at $300 million &mdash; the biggest to date &mdash; to restore power in Puerto Rico, where an <a href="http://status.pr/">estimated</a> 76% of the island is still without electricity four weeks after Hurricane Maria.</p><p>Subcontractors working for Whitefish Energy have been on the ground in Puerto Rico for several weeks, regularly updating progress on their <a href="https://twitter.com/whitefishenergy?lang=en">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WhitefishEnergy/">Facebook</a> pages. But the question remains how a company that had just two full-time employees and no office at the time the contract was granted was given such an immense mission, without a bidding process, in a territory currently $74 billion in debt.</p><p>The story was first reported on October 17 by <a href="https://weather.com/news/news/puerto-rico-power-whitefish">Weather.com</a>, citing confusion on the part of analysts &mdash; especially since an offer from the <a href="https://www.publicpower.org/our-members">American Public Power Association</a>, which is made up of 1,400 larger, far more experienced, publicly held companies and usually offers &ldquo;mutual aid&rdquo; assistance after disasters like Maria, had been ignored.</p><p>This choice puzzled many, including members of the House Committee on Natural Resources, which, according to the Washington Post, is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/small-montana-firm-lands-puerto-ricos-biggest-contract-to-get-the-power-back-on/2017/10/23/31cccc3e-b4d6-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.6b6f00ec4f99">now looking into the deal</a>, and the governor of Puerto Rico, who <a href="https://twitter.com/nickyodoesradio/status/922924711209705472">just called</a> for an audit of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority&rsquo;s energy contracts. <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/compass/2017/10/questions-swirl-around-secretary-zinke-and-300m-puerto-rico-reconstruction-contract">Some</a> <a href="http://mtcowgirl.com/2017/10/24/drip-drip-drip/">observers</a> have <a href="https://www.americanoversight.org/investigation/300m-puerto-rico-contract-zinke-linked-company">raised questions</a> about Whitefish Energy&rsquo;s ties to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a Whitefish native and acquaintance of Whitefish Energy CEO Andy Techmanski. Zinke&rsquo;s son Wolf previously worked as a flagger at one of Techmanski&rsquo;s worksites; when Whitefish Energy <a href="http://www.dailyinterlake.com/archive/article-476a16a2-c402-11e6-9e0d-d7bb58da643a.html">attempted to build a transistor plant</a> on a Superfund site in nearby Columbia Falls last year, then-congressman Zinke&rsquo;s office reached out to the city manager. Both Zinke and Techmanski have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/small-montana-firm-lands-puerto-ricos-biggest-contract-to-get-the-power-back-on/2017/10/23/31cccc3e-b4d6-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.ecbdbce5c27b">denied</a> that Zinke was involved in the procurement of the Puerto Rico contract.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, Joe Colonnetta, the head of one of Whitefish Energy&rsquo;s major funding sources, Dallas-based HBC Investments, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/dollar300m-puerto-rico-recovery-contract-awarded-to-tiny-utility-company-linked-to-major-trump-donor">has made significant donations</a> to Trump&rsquo;s election campaign and PACs supporting Trump&rsquo;s election. Colonnetta also contributed to the campaigns of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, as well as then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who later appointed Colonnetta to serve on the Board of Trustees of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which has been <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/09/rick-perry-teacher-pension-fund/2/">embroiled in controversy</a> surrounding allegations of cronyism on the part of Perry donors turned trustees. (In February 2017, a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/greg-abbott-fight-islamophobia-fire-joe-colonnetta-from-the-teacher-retirement-system-of-texas">Change.org petition</a> circulated to remove Colonnetta from his position, citing his involvement with the <a href="https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/">Center for Security Policy</a>, a far-right, anti-Muslim think tank that advocates against refugee resettlement. A spokeswoman for the Center for Security Policy said that Colonnetta was previously a general board member, but is not currently involved with the organization).</p>

	<p>The road to Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC.</p>


 <p><small>BuzzFeed News</small></p>




<p>Whitefish Energy spokesman Chris Chiames balked at the suggestion of cronyism or favoritism. &ldquo;There was no federal involvement,&rdquo; Chiames said. &ldquo;There was never any special favors asked, nor would there have been.&rdquo;</p><p>Outside of Montana, many are marveling that such connections could be traced to a small ski town of under 8,000 residents. But Whitefish &mdash; located just half an hour from Glacier National Park in the northwestern corner of Montana &mdash; is home to dozens of major political and business players, including Dave Lesar, who stepped down as CEO of Halliburton just last year, billionaire business magnate Bill Foley (whose business has donated $179,123 to Zinke&rsquo;s campaign, and who lobbied for Zinke&rsquo;s appointment as secretary of the interior), venture capitalist Michael Goguen (whose Whitefish home is the 11th largest in the country, and who exited his firm, Sequoia Capital, over a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/michael-goguen-sequoia-sex-abuse-case-silicon-valley">$40 million sexual assault case</a>) and former Montana governor, RNC chairman, and lobbyist Marc Racicot.<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether Colonnetta, who did not respond to a request for comment, has specific connections to Whitefish, or whether his stake in Whitefish Energy is simply a business investment. He and his family live in Dallas; public records show no evidence of property ownership in Montana. But many wealthy Dallas residents visit Whitefish to ski (according to the local tourist office, Texas is one of the top sources of winter tourists) and many have homes or have retired in the town and nearby Flathead Valley.</p><p>Whitefish Energy&rsquo;s website says the company&rsquo;s CEO is a &ldquo;trained journeyman lineman with over 22 years experience completing critical utility infrastructure projects worldwide.&rdquo; (According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-techmanski-23105120/">his LinkedIn profile</a>, Techmanski, a native of Baldwinsville, New York, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-techmanski-23105120/">has worked</a> with companies across the country and consulted on international electrical projects before relocating to Whitefish in 2015.) When hired, as it was earlier this year after being awarded its first federal contract &mdash; to build 4.8 miles of transmission line in Arizona &mdash; it partners and subcontracts according to the needs of the job. It&rsquo;s not a startup, per se, but like many Silicon Valley companies, its business model is to &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; the usual way of doing things; in this case, utility repair.</p><p>Whitefish Energy asserts that its expertise in &ldquo;rural and rugged areas&rdquo; makes it uniquely qualified for the job of restoring power to Puerto Rico. According to the company, it was the first willing to get on the ground and make things happen, and was not frightened away by Puerto Rico&rsquo;s debt load. Techmanski had been on vacation in Puerto Rico earlier in the summer, engaged in initial discussions with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority after Hurricane Irma, which had caused minor damage to the grid. Chiames told BuzzFeed News that after Hurricane Maria decimated the island, someone with a satellite phone was able to get ahold of Techmanski, who made it to Puerto Rico as quickly as possible and began laying the groundwork for the partnership to follow.</p><p>&ldquo;Whitefish Energy business model is based on a small core company with partners all over the place &mdash; in project management, implementation, HR, everything &mdash; so that they can scale really quickly,&rdquo; Chiames said. &ldquo;This model is designed to be efficient for our customers, who don&rsquo;t have to deal with hiring a bloated company. Our costs are designed to the specifics of our particular job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the Puerto Rico project, Whitefish Energy has partnered with Jacksonville Electric Authority, the New York Power Authority, and <a href="http://arcamerican.com/locations/">Arc American</a>, an electric utility contractor based in Indiana, with additional locations in South Dakota, Michigan, and Ohio. Arc, which declined to comment on the record or offer specifics of its financial partnership, is sending some of its own employees (including those who specialize in high-line, helicopter-assisted work) and assisting in hiring more employees out of Florida. Additional journeyman hires are being processed through the Jacksonville Electrical Union; according to Chiames, they&rsquo;re currently at 300 workers on the ground and growing that workforce by 10 to 20 a day.<br /></p><p>Chiames emphasized that this work is not what most people think of when they think of utility repair after a big storm, &ldquo;with the armada of trucks with their bucket lifts, repairing downed wires on the streets.&rdquo; Some of that work is going on in Puerto Rico&rsquo;s urban areas, but the larger project is repairing 100 miles of transmission lines that connect the territory&rsquo;s power plants, on the south of the island, over a mountain range, and into the north of the island, where most of the populated areas are located. In some cases, Whitefish Energy is building roads and excavating in order to even get to the lines; in others, they&rsquo;re lifted in by helicopter.</p><p>Arc has experience working with restoring power in areas affected by hurricanes and winter storms. But neither its workforce nor the one hired in Florida necessarily have the sort of mountainous experience that supposedly made Whitefish Energy a good fit for the contract. &ldquo;This is no job for amateurs,&rdquo; said a Montana native and utility expert who requested anonymity due to his continued affiliation with the industry. &ldquo;Hiring people in Florida might make sense if they had any idea how to do mountainous terrain, but otherwise it makes no sense. They likely have no experience in high-tension overland wiring, where you have a mile between utility lines.&rdquo;</p><p>Put differently, hiring Whitefish Energy would make sense if the company was actually bringing down large crews with experience doing utility repair in Montana &mdash; something a company like Montana Dakota Utilities, or Northwest Energy, would be capable of providing. But apart from Techmanski, it&rsquo;s unclear that the crews on the ground actually possess such expertise. (Whitefish Energy could not confirm the geographic source or proportion of its employees from Montana.)</p><p>The question remains whether a &ldquo;disrupter&rdquo; like Whitefish Energy can handle such a massive job under such tremendous pressure &mdash; and what will happen if it fails. &ldquo;I was originally so excited to see a Montana company taking this on,&rdquo; the electrical expert said. &ldquo;But now it&rsquo;s just fear &mdash; that they&rsquo;re gonna end up holding the bag, and that failure, it&rsquo;s all going to be on them.&rdquo;</p>

But the question remains how a company that had just two full-time employees and no office at the time the contract was granted was given such an immense mission, without a bidding process, in a territory currently $74 billion in debt.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The story was first reported on October 17 by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://weather.com/news/news/puerto-rico-power-whitefish&#x22;&#x3E;Weather.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, citing confusion on the part of analysts &#x26;mdash; especially since an offer from the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.publicpower.org/our-members&#x22;&#x3E;American Public Power Association&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, which is made up of 1,400 larger, far more experienced, publicly held companies and usually offers &#x26;ldquo;mutual aid&#x26;rdquo; assistance after disasters like Maria, had been ignored.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;This choice puzzled many, including members of the House Committee on Natural Resources, which, according to the Washington Post, is &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/small-montana-firm-lands-puerto-ricos-biggest-contract-to-get-the-power-back-on/2017/10/23/31cccc3e-b4d6-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.6b6f00ec4f99&#x22;&#x3E;now looking into the deal&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and the governor of Puerto Rico, who &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/nickyodoesradio/status/922924711209705472&#x22;&#x3E;just called&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for an audit of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority&#x26;rsquo;s energy contracts. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.sierraclub.org/compass/2017/10/questions-swirl-around-secretary-zinke-and-300m-puerto-rico-reconstruction-contract&#x22;&#x3E;Some&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://mtcowgirl.com/2017/10/24/drip-drip-drip/&#x22;&#x3E;observers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.americanoversight.org/investigation/300m-puerto-rico-contract-zinke-linked-company&#x22;&#x3E;raised questions&#x3C;/a&#x3E; about Whitefish Energy&#x26;rsquo;s ties to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a Whitefish native and acquaintance of Whitefish Energy CEO Andy Techmanski. Zinke&#x26;rsquo;s son Wolf previously worked as a flagger at one of Techmanski&#x26;rsquo;s worksites; when Whitefish Energy &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.dailyinterlake.com/archive/article-476a16a2-c402-11e6-9e0d-d7bb58da643a.html&#x22;&#x3E;attempted to build a transistor plant&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on a Superfund site in nearby Columbia Falls last year, then-congressman Zinke&#x26;rsquo;s office reached out to the city manager. Both Zinke and Techmanski have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/small-montana-firm-lands-puerto-ricos-biggest-contract-to-get-the-power-back-on/2017/10/23/31cccc3e-b4d6-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.ecbdbce5c27b&#x22;&#x3E;denied&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that Zinke was involved in the procurement of the Puerto Rico contract.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;What&#x26;rsquo;s more, Joe Colonnetta, the head of one of Whitefish Energy&#x26;rsquo;s major funding sources, Dallas-based HBC Investments, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.thedailybeast.com/dollar300m-puerto-rico-recovery-contract-awarded-to-tiny-utility-company-linked-to-major-trump-donor&#x22;&#x3E;has made significant donations&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to Trump&#x26;rsquo;s election campaign and PACs supporting Trump&#x26;rsquo;s election. Colonnetta also contributed to the campaigns of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, as well as then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who later appointed Colonnetta to serve on the Board of Trustees of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which has been &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/09/rick-perry-teacher-pension-fund/2/&#x22;&#x3E;embroiled in controversy&#x3C;/a&#x3E; surrounding allegations of cronyism on the part of Perry donors turned trustees. (In February 2017, a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.change.org/p/greg-abbott-fight-islamophobia-fire-joe-colonnetta-from-the-teacher-retirement-system-of-texas&#x22;&#x3E;Change.org petition&#x3C;/a&#x3E; circulated to remove Colonnetta from his position, citing his involvement with the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Center for Security Policy&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, a far-right, anti-Muslim think tank that advocates against refugee resettlement. A spokeswoman for the Center for Security Policy said that Colonnetta was previously a general board member, but is not currently involved with the organization).&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

	&#x3C;p&#x3E;The road to Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;


 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;Whitefish Energy spokesman Chris Chiames balked at the suggestion of cronyism or favoritism. &#x26;ldquo;There was no federal involvement,&#x26;rdquo; Chiames said. &#x26;ldquo;There was never any special favors asked, nor would there have been.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Outside of Montana, many are marveling that such connections could be traced to a small ski town of under 8,000 residents. But Whitefish &#x26;mdash; located just half an hour from Glacier National Park in the northwestern corner of Montana &#x26;mdash; is home to dozens of major political and business players, including Dave Lesar, who stepped down as CEO of Halliburton just last year, billionaire business magnate Bill Foley (whose business has donated $179,123 to Zinke&#x26;rsquo;s campaign, and who lobbied for Zinke&#x26;rsquo;s appointment as secretary of the interior), venture capitalist Michael Goguen (whose Whitefish home is the 11th largest in the country, and who exited his firm, Sequoia Capital, over a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/michael-goguen-sequoia-sex-abuse-case-silicon-valley&#x22;&#x3E;$40 million sexual assault case&#x3C;/a&#x3E;) and former Montana governor, RNC chairman, and lobbyist Marc Racicot.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It&#x26;rsquo;s unclear whether Colonnetta, who did not respond to a request for comment, has specific connections to Whitefish, or whether his stake in Whitefish Energy is simply a business investment. He and his family live in Dallas; public records show no evidence of property ownership in Montana. But many wealthy Dallas residents visit Whitefish to ski (according to the local tourist office, Texas is one of the top sources of winter tourists) and many have homes or have retired in the town and nearby Flathead Valley.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Whitefish Energy&#x26;rsquo;s website says the company&#x26;rsquo;s CEO is a &#x26;ldquo;trained journeyman lineman with over 22 years experience completing critical utility infrastructure projects worldwide.&#x26;rdquo; (According to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-techmanski-23105120/&#x22;&#x3E;his LinkedIn profile&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, Techmanski, a native of Baldwinsville, New York, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-techmanski-23105120/&#x22;&#x3E;has worked&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with companies across the country and consulted on international electrical projects before relocating to Whitefish in 2015.) When hired, as it was earlier this year after being awarded its first federal contract &#x26;mdash; to build 4.8 miles of transmission line in Arizona &#x26;mdash; it partners and subcontracts according to the needs of the job. It&#x26;rsquo;s not a startup, per se, but like many Silicon Valley companies, its business model is to &#x26;ldquo;disrupt&#x26;rdquo; the usual way of doing things; in this case, utility repair.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Whitefish Energy asserts that its expertise in &#x26;ldquo;rural and rugged areas&#x26;rdquo; makes it uniquely qualified for the job of restoring power to Puerto Rico. According to the company, it was the first willing to get on the ground and make things happen, and was not frightened away by Puerto Rico&#x26;rsquo;s debt load. Techmanski had been on vacation in Puerto Rico earlier in the summer, engaged in initial discussions with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority after Hurricane Irma, which had caused minor damage to the grid. Chiames told BuzzFeed News that after Hurricane Maria decimated the island, someone with a satellite phone was able to get ahold of Techmanski, who made it to Puerto Rico as quickly as possible and began laying the groundwork for the partnership to follow.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Whitefish Energy business model is based on a small core company with partners all over the place &#x26;mdash; in project management, implementation, HR, everything &#x26;mdash; so that they can scale really quickly,&#x26;rdquo; Chiames said. &#x26;ldquo;This model is designed to be efficient for our customers, who don&#x26;rsquo;t have to deal with hiring a bloated company. Our costs are designed to the specifics of our particular job.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;For the Puerto Rico project, Whitefish Energy has partnered with Jacksonville Electric Authority, the New York Power Authority, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://arcamerican.com/locations/&#x22;&#x3E;Arc American&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, an electric utility contractor based in Indiana, with additional locations in South Dakota, Michigan, and Ohio. Arc, which declined to comment on the record or offer specifics of its financial partnership, is sending some of its own employees (including those who specialize in high-line, helicopter-assisted work) and assisting in hiring more employees out of Florida. Additional journeyman hires are being processed through the Jacksonville Electrical Union; according to Chiames, they&#x26;rsquo;re currently at 300 workers on the ground and growing that workforce by 10 to 20 a day.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Chiames emphasized that this work is not what most people think of when they think of utility repair after a big storm, &#x26;ldquo;with the armada of trucks with their bucket lifts, repairing downed wires on the streets.&#x26;rdquo; Some of that work is going on in Puerto Rico&#x26;rsquo;s urban areas, but the larger project is repairing 100 miles of transmission lines that connect the territory&#x26;rsquo;s power plants, on the south of the island, over a mountain range, and into the north of the island, where most of the populated areas are located. In some cases, Whitefish Energy is building roads and excavating in order to even get to the lines; in others, they&#x26;rsquo;re lifted in by helicopter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Arc has experience working with restoring power in areas affected by hurricanes and winter storms. But neither its workforce nor the one hired in Florida necessarily have the sort of mountainous experience that supposedly made Whitefish Energy a good fit for the contract. &#x26;ldquo;This is no job for amateurs,&#x26;rdquo; said a Montana native and utility expert who requested anonymity due to his continued affiliation with the industry. &#x26;ldquo;Hiring people in Florida might make sense if they had any idea how to do mountainous terrain, but otherwise it makes no sense. They likely have no experience in high-tension overland wiring, where you have a mile between utility lines.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Put differently, hiring Whitefish Energy would make sense if the company was actually bringing down large crews with experience doing utility repair in Montana &#x26;mdash; something a company like Montana Dakota Utilities, or Northwest Energy, would be capable of providing. But apart from Techmanski, it&#x26;rsquo;s unclear that the crews on the ground actually possess such expertise. (Whitefish Energy could not confirm the geographic source or proportion of its employees from Montana.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The question remains whether a &#x26;ldquo;disrupter&#x26;rdquo; like Whitefish Energy can handle such a massive job under such tremendous pressure &#x26;mdash; and what will happen if it fails. &#x26;ldquo;I was originally so excited to see a Montana company taking this on,&#x26;rdquo; the electrical expert said. &#x26;ldquo;But now it&#x26;rsquo;s just fear &#x26;mdash; that they&#x26;rsquo;re gonna end up holding the bag, and that failure, it&#x26;rsquo;s all going to be on them.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<p><b>Marnie had to</b> <b>get the</b> bloody sweater off her father. He was crying, watching a twenty-year-old camcorder video of himself with Marnie&rsquo;s mother &mdash; footage of the two of them riding a giant mule at a county fair. He kept rewinding the video back to the scene where they jumped off of the mule in tandem. He&rsquo;d pause it there, so it looked like they were being sucked upright into the air, the two of them levitating beside the mule. Then he&rsquo;d press play, then rewind, then pause. Her father found this activity gratifying. So much so that he&rsquo;d recently quit his job to do it full-time.</p><p>Her mother had run off with a jazz musician several months ago, during the first week of Marnie&rsquo;s junior year of high school. She hadn&rsquo;t left contact information or been in touch since.</p><p>Marnie considered trying promiscuity as a distraction from grief, but was hesitant. It felt like her mother leaving increased Marnie&rsquo;s chances of an unwanted high school pregnancy. &ldquo;Think about it,&rdquo; Marnie told her friend. &ldquo;Say four girls hook-up with four football team members under the bleachers Friday night. All four guys pull out slightly late, but only one of the four girls gets knocked up. It would be the girl whose mother had abandoned her.&rdquo; Marnie had the sense that stigma did not readily consent to solitude. The disgrace of her mother leaving was a lodestar. A GPS that sent Marnie&rsquo;s coordinates to further misfortune.</p>











 <p>Wasn&rsquo;t magic just the act of appearing or disappearing, suddenly?</p>






<p>She figured traumatic desertion probably increased one&rsquo;s fertility. There was a magnified picture of cellular division in her biology textbook, and below it the book&rsquo;s previous owner had written GREED in red marker with teardrops coming off the word, like the letters were sweating. Maybe whoever drew this hadn&rsquo;t meant it as a caption for the photo, but Marnie felt that was the best interpretation. She could imagine the dumb, animal brain of her body thinking it had figured out a way to solve the void in her family. One person left me? No problem; I&rsquo;ll make another&#33;</p><p>It was best to stay vigilant against supernatural interventions like pregnancy, which seemed as eerily magical as her mother&rsquo;s overnight departure. Wasn&rsquo;t magic just the act of appearing or disappearing, suddenly? The sadness that arrived when her mother departed played tricks on Marnie. When her father had told her, he&rsquo;d said, &ldquo;Children shouldn&rsquo;t glimpse such uninhabitable honesty&rdquo;; in his despair his bathrobe had fallen a little too open. Although she didn&rsquo;t think of herself as a child, the statement seemed apt in regard to many aspects of her life. Panic now came upon her at school in sweaty fits, and when the urge to vocalize grew too intense to suppress, she&rsquo;d burst out in laughter to camouflage the hysteria. Marnie kept two halves of a broken pencil in her backpack to hold out as prop evidence as she cackled and shook. I&rsquo;m always breaking pencils and cannot help but laugh at the frequency&#33; Fractured wood, how hilarious&#33;</p><p>Pretending to laugh produced the same abdominal soreness as repetitive vomiting and made her smile muscles hurt. Between classes she liked to go into a bathroom stall and stretch the flesh of her cheeks out like pizza dough. As she kneaded her face, she&rsquo;d remember a song from childhood whose lyrics pretended English words all became Italian words with the suffix of &ndash;uh. It had been funny when she was little, but its lyrics lacked cultural intelligence. And it was mean, its main character &lsquo;uh big-uh fat-uh lady-uh.&rsquo; She saw now that the song was awful.</p><p>Perhaps this was the work of growing up, Marnie thought: increasing the ability and speed with which she could recognize the bad. She thought often of Puffy, a hamster she&rsquo;d owned for two years in elementary school. The day they&rsquo;d brought it home, her mother had washed it in baby shampoo so its fur had a floral smell. Marnie played with Puffy for hours, and then he defecated on her lap, which was a shock. Marnie hadn&rsquo;t realized the hamster was going to defecate. Ever. She&rsquo;d wept for hours, became withdrawn for weeks. Nothing was perfect.</p><p>Marnie&rsquo;s friend Jana felt her boyfriend was perfect, though. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so good,&rdquo; she was always telling Marnie. The boyfriend was older and had been fired from a fast food restaurant over allegations of theft from the cash register, though Jana staunchly maintained his innocence. Marnie had the feeling that over time, problematic information about him might come to light. Jana had recently gone on birth control, and she was very alarmed at how small the pills were. &ldquo;Do you see?&rdquo; she&rsquo;d asked, holding one out to Marnie on the tip of her finger, &ldquo;how microscopic these are? I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re even big enough to work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Marnie had agreed. &ldquo;They should be way bigger.&rdquo;</p>











 <p>Perhaps this was the work of growing up, Marnie thought: increasing the ability and speed with which she could recognize the bad.</p>






<p>Her mother&rsquo;s abandonment seemed to have given Marnie access inside a whole carnival tent of unwanted discoveries. For example, she learned that Gam-Gam, her paternal grandmother, had never been in favor of her parents&rsquo; union. Gam-Gam had a lot of opinions. She visited the two of them a few weeks after Marnie&rsquo;s mother went away.</p><p>No matter what Gam-Gam was saying, something about the tone and volume of her voice made Marnie feel like she was being ordered to mop a floor. &ldquo;Of course it ended in disaster,&rdquo; Gam-Gam yelled at Marnie&rsquo;s dad. &ldquo;You married for love&#33; Next time set yourself up for success,&rdquo; she encouraged, adding that he was welcome to borrow the recipe she&rsquo;d used for her own marriage to his father, now forty-eight years strong: he needed to seek out a tepid emotional connection, a person whose skill sets and interests were in direct opposition to his own. &ldquo;Because happiness isn&rsquo;t going to cut the mustard,&rdquo; Gam-Gam continued. &ldquo;There is no way in hell.&rdquo;</p><p>In terms of gossip, Marnie found out, dying was preferable to leaving. The dead can be hard to speak ill of, but no one had that problem regarding her mother. &ldquo;I heard your mom is a slut,&rdquo; a boy said at lunch. &ldquo;Are you a slut too?&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was a bullying tease or a straightforward inquiry. When she didn&rsquo;t answer he began eating a meatball sub at a fast-forward pace. Marnie wasn&rsquo;t sure why, but she&rsquo;d held out a napkin out to him. He didn&rsquo;t take it. Instead he wiped his forearm across his mouth and got sauce all over his skin. It looked like an injury. &ldquo;What are you staring at?&rdquo; the boy asked. Marnie didn&rsquo;t answer but continued to watch him. It was strange to see a person who appeared to be hurt eating instead of screaming or weeping. She wished her father would try eating. Due to the bloody sweater, her father now also seemed to have surface wounds on his body.</p>











 





<p><b>After he had stopped going</b> to work, Marnie had waited up one night until she heard his snores. He liked to pass out on the ground in front of the TV, watching the tape, then wake up and resume. He often watched it while lying on the ground in corpse-posture, limbs sprawled out, seemingly the fallen victim of a swift homicide. He&rsquo;d wake up with a red-patterned indention on whichever of his cheeks had pressed against the carpet all night. Every morning half his face appeared cloaked with a mysterious birthmark.</p><p>Marnie had taken the tape out of the player, gone outside and thrown the tape in the creek that ran out along the back acreage of their property. When she came back inside, her father was awake and the same tape was playing on the TV. &ldquo;I have several copies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but where&rsquo;s the one you took?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This video thing,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d offered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to do something with time?&rdquo;</p>











 <p>The dead can be hard to speak ill of, but no one had that problem regarding her mother.</p>






<p>&ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d asked, pointing to the screen. &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s eyes? Don&rsquo;t they seem to be looking into the future? Did she think our love was destined to fail even then?&rdquo; Marnie had glanced at the paused image. Was her father talking about her mother, or about the mule? Both looked unimpressed and a little hungry. They were squinting even though there was no sun.</p><p>She&rsquo;d turned off the TV and they&rsquo;d stared at each other. &ldquo;What are you wearing?&rdquo; she&rsquo;d finally asked him. It was a small white angora cardigan, buttoned but stretched beyond capacity; it ended several inches above his midriff. &ldquo;One of the only pieces of clothing your mother left behind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had to put it on. Does that seem crazy?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a free calendar from the credit union, several years old, that her mother hadn&rsquo;t thrown away because it had a motivational quote on each month&rsquo;s page. Whenever a question puzzled her, she used to open it and read a quote aloud by way of a response. Marnie had looked at her father and flipped to June: Unhappiness is in the eye of the beholder, it read. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t use the word crazy,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d answered.</p><p>When she told him the tape was in the creek, he&rsquo;d suggested they walk there and go fishing for a few hours. It was three a.m. on a school night. Marnie didn&rsquo;t like fishing; it seemed like fishing might be the only thing more miserable than standing in the living room with her father, which made her interested to try it. She liked challenging herself this way: On any given day, how much discomfort was she able to bear?</p><p>They took one reel with a lure and Marnie watched on, her father having promised to throw back anything he caught. But when the line did pull and he tugged up a bass, this vow proved hard to keep: it had swallowed the hook. The hook was caught on something deep inside the fish. She had to turn away while her father struggled to get it out. In the dark the blood looked like ink.

They&rsquo;d watched the fish&rsquo;s body float out across the water like a tiny canoe.

<p>On the walk back to the house, she remembered a day, unremarkable, when her mother had worn the sweater. She knew her father wasn&rsquo;t going to take it off willingly. He&rsquo;d continue to wear it, and when the blood dried he&rsquo;d act like any problem Marnie had with the garment had been reconciled.

<p>The last three minutes of the tape went like this: He and her mother jumped off the mule. They approached the camera and began talking about their upcoming wedding. But in the very distant background, the mule made a slow but immediate beeline out toward the palm tree lawn and started to give birth. &ldquo;Why were you riding a pregnant mule?&rdquo; Marnie asked. &ldquo;Not just one of you but two? That seems cruel.&rdquo; Maybe, she reasoned, if her parents hadn&rsquo;t given a pregnant mule trouble they&rsquo;d still be together.</p><p>This made Marnie hope her parents hadn&rsquo;t made a video recording of her mother giving birth to her.

It seemed like the type of obsessive careless action that, under certain conditions, could cause Marnie to cease to exist.</p><p>&ldquo;Did your collective weight induce the mule&rsquo;s labor?&rdquo; Marnie questioned. &ldquo;Be honest with me&#33;&rdquo; Her father cleared his throat and pressed rewind.

 &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Anna DeFlorian for BuzzFeed News&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;




&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Marnie had to&#x3C;/b&#x3E; &#x3C;b&#x3E;get the&#x3C;/b&#x3E; bloody sweater off her father. He was crying, watching a twenty-year-old camcorder video of himself with Marnie&#x26;rsquo;s mother &#x26;mdash; footage of the two of them riding a giant mule at a county fair. He kept rewinding the video back to the scene where they jumped off of the mule in tandem. He&#x26;rsquo;d pause it there, so it looked like they were being sucked upright into the air, the two of them levitating beside the mule. Then he&#x26;rsquo;d press play, then rewind, then pause. Her father found this activity gratifying. So much so that he&#x26;rsquo;d recently quit his job to do it full-time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Her mother had run off with a jazz musician several months ago, during the first week of Marnie&#x26;rsquo;s junior year of high school. She hadn&#x26;rsquo;t left contact information or been in touch since.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Marnie considered trying promiscuity as a distraction from grief, but was hesitant. It felt like her mother leaving increased Marnie&#x26;rsquo;s chances of an unwanted high school pregnancy. &#x26;ldquo;Think about it,&#x26;rdquo; Marnie told her friend. &#x26;ldquo;Say four girls hook-up with four football team members under the bleachers Friday night. All four guys pull out slightly late, but only one of the four girls gets knocked up. It would be the girl whose mother had abandoned her.&#x26;rdquo; Marnie had the sense that stigma did not readily consent to solitude. The disgrace of her mother leaving was a lodestar. A GPS that sent Marnie&#x26;rsquo;s coordinates to further misfortune.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;Wasn&#x26;rsquo;t magic just the act of appearing or disappearing, suddenly?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;She figured traumatic desertion probably increased one&#x26;rsquo;s fertility. There was a magnified picture of cellular division in her biology textbook, and below it the book&#x26;rsquo;s previous owner had written GREED in red marker with teardrops coming off the word, like the letters were sweating. Maybe whoever drew this hadn&#x26;rsquo;t meant it as a caption for the photo, but Marnie felt that was the best interpretation. She could imagine the dumb, animal brain of her body thinking it had figured out a way to solve the void in her family. One person left me? No problem; I&#x26;rsquo;ll make another&#x26;#33;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was best to stay vigilant against supernatural interventions like pregnancy, which seemed as eerily magical as her mother&#x26;rsquo;s overnight departure. Wasn&#x26;rsquo;t magic just the act of appearing or disappearing, suddenly? The sadness that arrived when her mother departed played tricks on Marnie. When her father had told her, he&#x26;rsquo;d said, &#x26;ldquo;Children shouldn&#x26;rsquo;t glimpse such uninhabitable honesty&#x26;rdquo;; in his despair his bathrobe had fallen a little too open. Although she didn&#x26;rsquo;t think of herself as a child, the statement seemed apt in regard to many aspects of her life. Panic now came upon her at school in sweaty fits, and when the urge to vocalize grew too intense to suppress, she&#x26;rsquo;d burst out in laughter to camouflage the hysteria. Marnie kept two halves of a broken pencil in her backpack to hold out as prop evidence as she cackled and shook. I&#x26;rsquo;m always breaking pencils and cannot help but laugh at the frequency&#x26;#33; Fractured wood, how hilarious&#x26;#33;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Pretending to laugh produced the same abdominal soreness as repetitive vomiting and made her smile muscles hurt. Between classes she liked to go into a bathroom stall and stretch the flesh of her cheeks out like pizza dough. As she kneaded her face, she&#x26;rsquo;d remember a song from childhood whose lyrics pretended English words all became Italian words with the suffix of &#x26;ndash;uh. It had been funny when she was little, but its lyrics lacked cultural intelligence. And it was mean, its main character &#x26;lsquo;uh big-uh fat-uh lady-uh.&#x26;rsquo; She saw now that the song was awful.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Perhaps this was the work of growing up, Marnie thought: increasing the ability and speed with which she could recognize the bad. She thought often of Puffy, a hamster she&#x26;rsquo;d owned for two years in elementary school. The day they&#x26;rsquo;d brought it home, her mother had washed it in baby shampoo so its fur had a floral smell. Marnie played with Puffy for hours, and then he defecated on her lap, which was a shock. Marnie hadn&#x26;rsquo;t realized the hamster was going to defecate. Ever. She&#x26;rsquo;d wept for hours, became withdrawn for weeks. Nothing was perfect.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Marnie&#x26;rsquo;s friend Jana felt her boyfriend was perfect, though. &#x26;ldquo;He&#x26;rsquo;s so good,&#x26;rdquo; she was always telling Marnie. The boyfriend was older and had been fired from a fast food restaurant over allegations of theft from the cash register, though Jana staunchly maintained his innocence. Marnie had the feeling that over time, problematic information about him might come to light. Jana had recently gone on birth control, and she was very alarmed at how small the pills were. &#x26;ldquo;Do you see?&#x26;rdquo; she&#x26;rsquo;d asked, holding one out to Marnie on the tip of her finger, &#x26;ldquo;how microscopic these are? I don&#x26;rsquo;t think they&#x26;rsquo;re even big enough to work.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Yeah,&#x26;rdquo; Marnie had agreed. &#x26;ldquo;They should be way bigger.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;Perhaps this was the work of growing up, Marnie thought: increasing the ability and speed with which she could recognize the bad.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;Her mother&#x26;rsquo;s abandonment seemed to have given Marnie access inside a whole carnival tent of unwanted discoveries. For example, she learned that Gam-Gam, her paternal grandmother, had never been in favor of her parents&#x26;rsquo; union. Gam-Gam had a lot of opinions. She visited the two of them a few weeks after Marnie&#x26;rsquo;s mother went away.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;No matter what Gam-Gam was saying, something about the tone and volume of her voice made Marnie feel like she was being ordered to mop a floor. &#x26;ldquo;Of course it ended in disaster,&#x26;rdquo; Gam-Gam yelled at Marnie&#x26;rsquo;s dad. &#x26;ldquo;You married for love&#x26;#33; Next time set yourself up for success,&#x26;rdquo; she encouraged, adding that he was welcome to borrow the recipe she&#x26;rsquo;d used for her own marriage to his father, now forty-eight years strong: he needed to seek out a tepid emotional connection, a person whose skill sets and interests were in direct opposition to his own. &#x26;ldquo;Because happiness isn&#x26;rsquo;t going to cut the mustard,&#x26;rdquo; Gam-Gam continued. &#x26;ldquo;There is no way in hell.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In terms of gossip, Marnie found out, dying was preferable to leaving. The dead can be hard to speak ill of, but no one had that problem regarding her mother. &#x26;ldquo;I heard your mom is a slut,&#x26;rdquo; a boy said at lunch. &#x26;ldquo;Are you a slut too?&#x26;rdquo; She couldn&#x26;rsquo;t tell if it was a bullying tease or a straightforward inquiry. When she didn&#x26;rsquo;t answer he began eating a meatball sub at a fast-forward pace. Marnie wasn&#x26;rsquo;t sure why, but she&#x26;rsquo;d held out a napkin out to him. He didn&#x26;rsquo;t take it. Instead he wiped his forearm across his mouth and got sauce all over his skin. It looked like an injury. &#x26;ldquo;What are you staring at?&#x26;rdquo; the boy asked. Marnie didn&#x26;rsquo;t answer but continued to watch him. It was strange to see a person who appeared to be hurt eating instead of screaming or weeping. She wished her father would try eating. Due to the bloody sweater, her father now also seemed to have surface wounds on his body.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 





&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;After he had stopped going&#x3C;/b&#x3E; to work, Marnie had waited up one night until she heard his snores. He liked to pass out on the ground in front of the TV, watching the tape, then wake up and resume. He often watched it while lying on the ground in corpse-posture, limbs sprawled out, seemingly the fallen victim of a swift homicide. He&#x26;rsquo;d wake up with a red-patterned indention on whichever of his cheeks had pressed against the carpet all night. Every morning half his face appeared cloaked with a mysterious birthmark.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Marnie had taken the tape out of the player, gone outside and thrown the tape in the creek that ran out along the back acreage of their property. When she came back inside, her father was awake and the same tape was playing on the TV. &#x26;ldquo;I have several copies,&#x26;rdquo; he said, &#x26;ldquo;but where&#x26;rsquo;s the one you took?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;This video thing,&#x26;rdquo; she&#x26;rsquo;d offered. &#x26;ldquo;You&#x26;rsquo;re trying to do something with time?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;The dead can be hard to speak ill of, but no one had that problem regarding her mother.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;






&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Do you see that?&#x26;rdquo; he&#x26;rsquo;d asked, pointing to the screen. &#x26;ldquo;Your mother&#x26;rsquo;s eyes? Don&#x26;rsquo;t they seem to be looking into the future? Did she think our love was destined to fail even then?&#x26;rdquo; Marnie had glanced at the paused image. Was her father talking about her mother, or about the mule? Both looked unimpressed and a little hungry. They were squinting even though there was no sun.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;She&#x26;rsquo;d turned off the TV and they&#x26;rsquo;d stared at each other. &#x26;ldquo;What are you wearing?&#x26;rdquo; she&#x26;rsquo;d finally asked him. It was a small white angora cardigan, buttoned but stretched beyond capacity; it ended several inches above his midriff. &#x26;ldquo;One of the only pieces of clothing your mother left behind,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;I had to put it on. Does that seem crazy?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;There was a free calendar from the credit union, several years old, that her mother hadn&#x26;rsquo;t thrown away because it had a motivational quote on each month&#x26;rsquo;s page. Whenever a question puzzled her, she used to open it and read a quote aloud by way of a response. Marnie had looked at her father and flipped to June: Unhappiness is in the eye of the beholder, it read. &#x26;ldquo;I wouldn&#x26;rsquo;t use the word crazy,&#x26;rdquo; she&#x26;rsquo;d answered.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;When she told him the tape was in the creek, he&#x26;rsquo;d suggested they walk there and go fishing for a few hours. It was three a.m. on a school night. Marnie didn&#x26;rsquo;t like fishing; it seemed like fishing might be the only thing more miserable than standing in the living room with her father, which made her interested to try it. She liked challenging herself this way: On any given day, how much discomfort was she able to bear?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;They took one reel with a lure and Marnie watched on, her father having promised to throw back anything he caught. But when the line did pull and he tugged up a bass, this vow proved hard to keep: it had swallowed the hook. The hook was caught on something deep inside the fish. She had to turn away while her father struggled to get it out. In the dark the blood looked like ink. The average-sized fish was leaking so much of it that in another context it would&#x26;rsquo;ve seemed comical &#x26;mdash; her father&#x26;rsquo;s arms and her mother&#x26;rsquo;s sweater looked like they&#x26;rsquo;d been drenched in gallons of fish blood. &#x26;ldquo;Okay,&#x26;rdquo; he&#x26;rsquo;d finally said. &#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;rsquo;s good as new.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Marnie had disagreed. They&#x26;rsquo;d watched the fish&#x26;rsquo;s body float out across the water like a tiny canoe. Then it gave a twitch and they both gasped: &#x26;ldquo;There it goes,&#x26;rdquo; her father said. &#x26;ldquo;It&#x26;rsquo;s going to swim away.&#x26;rdquo; But it was just a death lurch, or maybe something from below had poked it. &#x26;ldquo;We&#x26;rsquo;re not going to find the video tape,&#x26;rdquo; Marnie said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Hey,&#x26;rdquo; her father added, his face perking up with suggestion. &#x26;ldquo;Let&#x26;rsquo;s go inside and watch it?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 





&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the walk back to the house, she remembered a day, unremarkable, when her mother had worn the sweater. She knew her father wasn&#x26;rsquo;t going to take it off willingly. He&#x26;rsquo;d continue to wear it, and when the blood dried he&#x26;rsquo;d act like any problem Marnie had with the garment had been reconciled.

Her father wasn&#x26;rsquo;t interested in the most terrible event captured on the tape, which played out in the shot&#x26;rsquo;s farthest right corner during the final moments of the recording.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;











 &#x3C;p&#x3E;She liked challenging herself this way: On any given day, how much discomfort was she able to bear?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

But in the very distant background, the mule made a slow but immediate beeline out toward the palm tree lawn and started to give birth. &#x26;ldquo;Why were you riding a pregnant mule?&#x26;rdquo; Marnie asked. &#x26;ldquo;Not just one of you but two?

It wasn&#x26;rsquo;t the thought of the delivery on tape that made her skin crawl as much as the idea of her father pressing rewind and then play, again and again, reversing nature&#x26;rsquo;s decision. It seemed like the type of obsessive careless action that, under certain conditions, could cause Marnie to cease to exist.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Did your collective weight induce the mule&#x26;rsquo;s labor?&#x26;rdquo; Marnie questioned. &#x26;ldquo;Be honest with me&#x26;#33;&#x26;rdquo; Her father cleared his throat and pressed rewind.

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be scared, you are not alone, I love you, New York loves you, and we will protect you.&#8221; From Signs of Hope: Messages from Subway Therapy.</p>












 

 
	<h1>In the days after the 2016 US presidential election, subway tunnels in New York City began to become covered in sticky notes containing moving messages of hope, compassion, and unity.</h1>

 <blockquote>

<p>In May of 2016, I created Subway Therapy to explore how people feel better about the things they feel bad about. For months I had face to face conversations as "the subway therapist," but after the election I wanted to reach more people. I brought sticky notes into the subway so commuters could write something quickly on their way to or from work. New York is generally a lonely and stressful place to live and I wanted to provide an opportunity for spontaneous connection and relief.</p>

<p>Aside from making people happy, I hope participants walk away empowered to make a difference in their own way. Worldwide, we face incredibly complex problems, and I hope projects like mine inspire people to develop creative solutions.</p>
