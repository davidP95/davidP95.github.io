<p>Just after <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/926218142535307265">snapping a photo</a> of the overnight campout line outside the Philly Apple Store, one of the teens in line noticed that I was taking the picture with an iPhone X. They had questions. So I interviewed them.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s only one week of iPhone 8 sales in these results, but the average selling price for iPhone was effectively unchanged from the year-ago quarter, and total unit sales were slightly up. So much for those reports that the year-old iPhone 7 was outselling the iPhone 8. iPad and Mac unit sales are both up about 10 percent year-over-year.</p>

<p>Guidance for next quarter is insane: &#8220;revenue between $84 billion and $87 billion&#8221;. Last year for the holiday quarter Apple reported <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/01/apple-reports-record-first-quarter-results/">$78.4 billion in revenue</a>, which was a record for the company. Even the low end of Apple&#8217;s guidance would shatter that record.</p>

<p>Another very astute take on Apple&#8217;s iPhone X marketing strategy, this one by Christina Bonnington for Slate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re reading an iPhone review on The Verge, or Engadget, or
Wired, chances are you aren’t hemming and hawing about whether you
want to buy the new device. Readers of those sites are already
passionate about technology, have strong opinions about it, and
often have the money to buy what they want. They’re also largely
older and male. (As of 2017, the Wired audience was 57% male, with
an average age of 42.) Apple doesn’t need to market as
aggressively to this audience, which will seek out information
about its products regardless.</p>

<p>Who Apple does want to market to: women and teens. According to
<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/29/technology/apple-customers/index.html">2015 data from Slice Analytics</a>, older men spend the most on
Apple products, while women aged 25 to 34 spend the least. Men of
every age category (18-plus) outspent women of the same age range,
and buyers tended to spend more money on Apple products as they
got older. On top of that, women reportedly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bridgetbrennan/2015/01/21/top-10-things-everyone-should-know-about-women-consumers/#4b6405546a8b">account for 70</a>
to <a href="https://girlpowermarketing.com/statistics-purchasing-power-women/">85 percent</a> of all consumer purchases and, <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/u-s--women-control-the-purse-strings.html">according to
Nielsen Consumer</a>, have a buying power worth $5 to $15 trillion
annually.</p>

<p>What all this means: Apple needs to focus its marketing efforts on
millennials, teens, and wallet-controlling female buyers if it
wants to expand its reach in the U.S., where Android controls 65
percent of the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great piece by Matt Alexander, analyzing Apple&#8217;s new PR strategy for iPhone X:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would Apple go about accomplishing these goals?</p>

<p>Simply put, they’d create a crashing wave, of sorts, of press
around the product, which would enable them to control and
manipulate consumer perception of the news, regardless of how more
technical reviewers may feel.</p>

<p>Lesson learned from the Apple Watch Series 3 launch, the tech
press created a huge amount of uproar about the device being
unable to maintain an LTE connection. Although this was explained
within hours of those reviews being published, it was already too
late for the average consumer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Alexander nailed Apple&#8217;s thinking on this. I do think Apple felt burned by the fact that day one coverage of Apple Watch Series 3 was dominated by the Wi-Fi hotspot bug encountered by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-series-3-review-untethered-and-unreliable-1505905203">The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Joanna Stern</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16334066/apple-watch-series-3-lte-new-features-review-2017">The Verge&#8217;s Lauren Goode</a> that seemingly rendered cellular networking &#8212; the product&#8217;s signature feature! &#8212; inoperative. The news that it was just a simple bug and would soon be fixed (which turned out to be true) didn&#8217;t spread nearly as widely.</p>

<p>In short, Apple wants control over the narrative for its products, and in-depth reviews are mostly out of their control.</p>

<p>They can&#8217;t have it both ways though. Apple yesterday posted &#8220;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/11/iphone-x-what-reviewers-are-saying/">iPhone X: What Reviewers Are Saying</a>&#8221; to their Newsroom blog, but most of the quotes were from &#8220;reviews&#8221; which were written by people who&#8217;d only spent a few hours with the phone.</p>

<p>Stephen Nellis, reporting for Reuters under the headline &#8220;App Developer Access to iPhone X Face Data Spooks Some Privacy Experts&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc won accolades from privacy experts in September for
assuring that facial data used to unlock its new iPhone X would be
securely stored on the phone itself.</p>

<p>But Apple’s privacy promises do not extend to the thousands of app
developers who will gain access to facial data in order to build
entertainment features for iPhone X customers, such as pinning a
three-dimensional mask to their face for a selfie or letting a
video game character mirror the player’s real-world facial
expressions.</p>

<p>Apple allows developers to take certain facial data off the phone
as long as they agree to seek customer permission and not sell the
data to third parties, among other terms in a contract seen by
Reuters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is dangerously misleading FUD. I say &#8220;dangerous&#8221; because this is the sort of story that could lead people to not set up Face ID, leaving their iPhones less secure and less useful.</p>

<p>There is no way, opt-in or otherwise, for third-party apps to access Face ID data. Face ID data is stored on the iPhone X&#8217;s secure enclave &#8212; even the OS itself can&#8217;t read it.</p>

<p>What third-party apps <em>do</em> have access to, if granted permission, is the front-facing camera with the TrueDepth sensor. That&#8217;s it. Apps have access to a front-facing camera that is better than previous front-facing cameras because it has 3D depth mapping. An app (like Snapchat or Instagram) can use this to implement augmented reality features like putting a mask or fake mustache on your face, but that has nothing to do with Face ID. I don&#8217;t think this is any more privacy invasive than what these apps are already doing with your iPhone camera &#8212; it&#8217;s just more accurate spatially for AR effects.</p>

<p>Charlie Warzel, reporting for BuzzFeed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The debate appears to be between some of Unicode’s most prolific
contributors and typographers (Unicode was initially established
to develop standards for translating alphabets into code that can
be read across all computers and operating systems), and those in
the consortium who focus primarily on the evolution of emojis. The
two chief critics &#8212; Michael Everson and Andrew West, both
typographers &#8212; say that the emoji proposal process has become too
commercial and frivolous, thereby cheapening the Unicode
Consortium’s long body of work.</p>

<p>Their argument centers around “Frowning Pile Of Poo,” one of the
emojis under consideration for the June 2018 class. In an Oct. 22
memo to the Unicode Technical Committee, Everson tore into the
committee over the submission calling it “damaging &#8230; to the
Unicode standard.”</p>

<p>“Organic waste isn’t cute,” Everson wrote, aghast that the
technical committee would even deign to consider additional
excremoji. “It is bad enough that the [Emoji Subcommittee] came up
with it, but it beggars belief that the [Unicode Technical
Committee] actually approved it,” he wrote. Everson continued:</p>

<p>“The idea that our 5 committees would sanction further cute
graphic characters based on this should embarrass absolutely
everyone who votes yes on such an excrescence. Will we have a
CRYING PILE OF POO next? PILE OF POO WITH TONGUE STICKING OUT?
PILE OF POO WITH QUESTION MARKS FOR EYES? PILE OF POO WITH KARAOKE
MIC? Will we have to encode a neutral FACELESS PILE OF POO?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m all for taking most of the Unicode Consortium&#8217;s work deliberately and seriously, but emoji are inherently frivolous. The frivolity of emoji is why they&#8217;re so sensationally popular.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/simonw/status/926129455302459394">Simon Willison</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I love how the fact that unicode chars are referred to by their
name IN CAPS makes everyone seem even more angry.</p>

<p>Apple seems to be going out of its way not to give the horizontal bar at the bottom of the iPhone X user interface a name. For example, in the &#8220;getting started&#8221; pamphlet that ships in the iPhone X box, they don&#8217;t give it a name. They just show a picture of it, with an arrow indicating the gesture, and say &#8220;Swipe up to go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those of us who write about these things need a name for it, though. I suggest &#8220;home indicator&#8221;. In <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/iphone-x/">Apple&#8217;s Human Interface Guidelines for iPhone X</a>, they use a similar but more verbose construction: &#8220;the indicator for accessing the Home screen&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/2887510-prefershomeindicatorautohidden">It&#8217;s also called the home &#8220;indicator&#8221; in the UIKit APIs</a>.

<p>One frustration I have with the way iCloud backups work is that they don&#8217;t (<a href="https://twitter.com/DesignCzar/status/925801099730268161">at least for me</a>?) seem to back up custom ringtones. So when I set up my iPhone X review unit, I restored from an iCloud backup of my personal iPhone 7. None of my custom ringtones &#8212; neither the ones I bought from iTunes nor the ones I created and installed manually &#8212; made it to the new phone.</p>

<p>Previously, you could copy these over by connecting the phone to iTunes over a USB cable. But <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208075">iTunes 12.7 dropped support for managing things like ringtones and iOS apps</a>. And searching the web for an answer to this gave me a long list of articles that were all outdated. This support document from Rogue Amoeba (whose audio editing app Fission is a great tool for creating your own ringtones) explains how to do it with iTunes 12.7 &#8212; and also tells you how to restore the tones you previously purchased from the iTunes Store.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A few readers have chimed in to say that their custom ringtones do get backed up and restored by iCloud, so maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with my iCloud backup. <a href="https://twitter.com/ampressman/status/925799962423652353">But I&#8217;m not alone</a>. I seem to recall running into this same problem every time I get a new iPhone. But even putting that aside, it seems to me that managing these ringtones is something iOS should be able to handle on its own &#8212; especially now that iOS has a Files app. There aren’t many things left you need to connect to a Mac or a PC to manage on iOS, but ringtones are one.</p>

<p>Paul Kafasis was on pace to hit an ambitious activity goal for October (3,347 exercise minutes for the month). But then he updated to iOS 11.1 on his phone and WatchOS 4.1 on his watch yesterday, and, somehow, the numbers add up differently. Very strange bug &#8212; computers are usually pretty good at math.</p>

<p>Mark Spoonauer, writing for Tom&#8217;s Guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;ve been using Face ID on the iPhone X for more than 24 hours,
and I don&#8217;t need a stopwatch to tell you that it unlocks my phone
slower than when I was using Touch ID on my older iPhone 7 Plus. I
used a stopwatch app anyway to prove my point.</p>

<p>With Face ID on the iPhone X, it took 1.2 seconds from pressing
the side button to the iPhone X&#8217;s screen turning on and for the
phone to recognize me and unlock the device. And it was another
0.4 seconds to swipe up to get to the lock screen. Total time: 1.8
seconds.</p>

<p>On my iPhone 7 Plus, I could get to the home screen just by
pressing and holding my thumb on the Touch ID sensor in an
average of 0.91 seconds. That might not seem like a lot of time,
but it adds up quickly when you&#8217;re unlocking your phone dozens of
time a day.</p>

<p>There is a workaround of sorts, though. You can swipe up from the
bottom of the iPhone X&#8217;s screen even while the iPhone X is looking
for your face. Sometimes you might briefly see the word &#8220;Face ID&#8221;
flash as the iPhone X transitions to the home screen, but you will
still get to start using your phone faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a &#8220;workaround&#8221;. This is how you&#8217;re supposed to unlock iPhone X. Starting with a tap of the side button is <em>not</em> how you&#8217;re supposed to do it &#8212; you&#8217;re creating a two-step process where you only need one.</p>

<p>If raise-to-wake kicks in and turns on the display, all you need to do is swipe up from the bottom. Don&#8217;t wait for the lock icon to change &#8212; don&#8217;t even worry about it. Just swipe up. If raise-to-wake hasn&#8217;t kicked in, and you&#8217;re holding your iPhone X in your hand with the display off, just tap the screen near the bottom and immediately swipe up. The best way to use Face ID is to pretend it isn&#8217;t even there, and just swipe up from the home indicator.</p>

<p>Tapping the screen to wake the display is one of my favorite features so far. There&#8217;s really no reason to use the side button to wake the phone.</p>

<p>Lance Ulanoff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Apple made the choice to drop the home button and Touch ID
fingerprint scanning in favor of Face ID, Riccio said they went
“all in” with that functional decision. “We spent no time looking
at [putting] fingerprints on the back or through the glass or on
the side,” he said. Apple did it because they believed in the
quality of Face ID security and screen unlocking, with executives
describing it as good as second-generation Touch ID, but also
because there simply wasn’t time.</p>

<p>“As far as last-minute design changes? Actually, we didn’t have
time for it,” said Riccio, who seemed energized by the memory of
that intense development period. “Quite frankly, this program
was on such a fast track to be offered [and] enabled this year.
We had to lock [the design] very, very early. We actually locked
the design, to let you know, in November,” said Riccio before he
was cut off by Apple PR. Riccio appeared to realize he’d said
maybe too much, and then reaffirmed with a smile, “We had to
lock it early.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple does not like talking about product development timelines. How long it takes them to design and ship a product is something they consider competitive information. But they could cut off the annual cycle of silly rumors about how they&#8217;re &#8220;scrambling&#8221; to make last-minute changes to the iPhone in July and August. The iPhone X was &#8220;locked&#8221; almost a year ago.</p>

	<summary type="text">First impressions of the iPhone X, and comments on Matthew Panzarino’s and Nicole Nguyen’s reviews.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Because I’ve only had about 24 hours with the iPhone X, I’m in no position to write a review yet. But my quick take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Face ID works great. In practice it&#8217;s like not even having a passcode on the phone. You just swipe and you&#8217;re in. It&#8217;s also very quick to set up &#8212; way quicker than setting up even a single fingerprint in Touch ID.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t really notice the notch while using it.</li>
<li>I do notice the lack of a home button. I think I&#8217;ll get used to the new no-home-button UI soon, but 10 years of habits die hard.</li>
<li>The device feels great.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was far from alone in not getting an extended period of time to test the phone before the review embargo lifted.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what others are saying in their reviews.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/review-the-iphone-x-goes-to-disneyland/">Matthew Panzarino used iPhone X for a week</a>, and stress-tested it with a family trip to Disneyland. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/17/life-is-tough/">He did the same thing with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus three years ago</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s a great conceit for a review.) He also got on-the-record interviews with Phil Schiller, Dan Riccio, Craig Federighi, and Alan Dye. Riccio flatly denied reports that Apple was scrambling to get Touch ID working with iPhone X:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I heard some rumor [that] we couldn’t get Touch ID to work
through the glass so we had to remove that,” Riccio says,
answering a question about whether there were late design
changes. “When we hit early line of sight on getting Face ID to
be [as] good as it was, we knew that if we could be successful we
could enable the product that we wanted to go off and do and if
that’s true it could be something that we could burn the bridges
and be all in with. This is assuming it was a better solution.
And that’s what we did. So we spent no time looking at
fingerprints on the back or through the glass or on the side
because if we did those things, which would be a last-minute
change, they would be a distraction relative to enabling the more
important thing that we were trying to achieve, which was Face ID
done in a high-quality way.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Panzarino, on the iPhone X&#8217;s OLED display:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hate to say it, but it makes the iPhone 8 Plus LCD look kind
of like butt. I love it, even though it is flawed in one
noticeable way.</p>

<p>The one area where this display falls prey to standard OLED gripes
is in off-axis viewing. Apple tells me that it has done work to
counter the drop in saturation and shift to blue that affects OLED
screens traditionally. I can tell you that, compared to other OLED
screens, you have to get further “off of center” to see a real
shift in color, holding the phone 30 degrees or more off of dead
on. But it is still there. For people who share their phone’s
screen or use it at odd angles a lot, it will be noticeable. On
some phones, OLEDs go super blue. On the iPhone X it’s more of a
slight blue shift with a reduction in saturation and dynamic
range. It’s not terrible, but it definitely exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see the same thing with mine.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolenguyen/iphone-x-review">Nicole Nguyen also used iPhone X for a week and wrote a great review for BuzzFeed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whatever. I don’t feel strongly about the notch either way, but
it’s really the <em>other</em> end of the screen that feels awkward. It’s
when the keyboard, in any app, is on screen (which, for me, is
most of the time): There’s all this dead space on the bottom,
where Apple could have put common punctuation, frequently used
emojis, or literally anything, but instead left it blank. Other
full-screen apps on other phones put navigation or other design
elements in that area, and it doesn’t look crowded or crammed. It
looks fine. It’s puzzling why Apple didn’t put something more
useful down at the bottom, or why it didn’t add a row of numbers
or emojis up top and push down the keyboard to make it more
thumb-accessible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does look like a waste of space, but I wonder if testing showed that there needs to be some space under the keyboard to separate it from the virtual home button? If there weren&#8217;t a gap under the keyboard, you might hit the home button while trying to hit the space bar, and vice versa. <strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve heard from a little birdie that my speculation is correct; also: it&#8217;s about typing comfort.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a normal human who isn’t aware of the 30,000 invisible dots
being projected on their face or the 3D map of their head
encrypted somewhere deep inside their phone, there’s nothing
“futuristic” about these interactions. Using Face ID is what life
without a passcode &#8212; life before we all became paranoid
technofreaks &#8212; felt like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s my take too. It&#8217;s like not having a passcode set.</p>

<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2017/10/31/apple-iphone-x-review/#oUrsAmC5oaqH">Lance Ulanoff, in his review for Mashable</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During my first 24 hours of using the iPhone X, I helplessly
pressed the space where a button should be. It’s a kind of Phantom
Home Button Syndrome that I expect all iPhone X owners will
experience in the early days.</p>

<p>It fades, though, and rather quickly, thanks to a smartly designed
gesture interface and something Apple calls Face ID. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>One important limitation of Face ID: It only lets you register one
face. That may strike many as unnecessarily limiting since Touch
ID lets users register up to 10 fingerprints, but Apple says it
found the number of people who register more than one person&#8217;s
fingerprints is miniscule. There&#8217;s also the simple and obvious
fact that humans have 10 fingers, but just one face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s only a minuscule number. I&#8217;ve got a fingerprint registered on my son&#8217;s iPhone &#8212; I&#8217;m sure other parents do the same thing. And last week my wife let me put a fingerprint on her iPhone so I could use Apple Pay while pre-ordering her iPhone X while she slept.</p>

<p>Tripp Mickle, writing for The Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. departed from its traditional preview strategy for what
it bills as its most important new iPhone in years, prioritizing
early access to the iPhone X for YouTube personalities and
celebrities over most technology columnists who traditionally
review its new products.</p>

<p>Apple provided the iPhone X to a small number of traditional
testers for about a week, while limiting most others, The Wall
Street Journal included, to a single day with the device before
reviews could be published. About a half-dozen personalities on
Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube video service were granted time with the
device before its release. </p>

<p>The company seeded the iPhone X to at least three influencers with
different audiences: actor Mindy Kaling, who shared her thoughts
with Glamour; 12-year-old developer Alex Knoll, who showed off the
device on Ellen DeGeneres’s television show; and political
journalist Mike Allen, who included insights from his tech-savvy
nephew in Axios’s morning newsletter.</p>

<p>Traditional publications and tech outlets that in past years
received review models for a week of testing were given the iPhone
X fewer than 24 hours ago, resulting in crash reviews and
first-impression takes from USA Today, the Washington Post, the
Verge and others.</p>

<p>In the U.S., BuzzFeed, TechCrunch and Mashable were given a week
with the iPhone X, as were the Telegraph and the Independent in
the United Kingdom. The device also was given for a week to
outlets in Japan, China, Australia and other countries. Stephen
Levy of Wired, among the handful of people to test the first-ever
iPhone, spent a week with the iPhone X and posted his “first look”
impressions a day before most other publications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally get including a bunch of YouTubers, and seeding review units to celebrities. YouTube is how young people get their news and reviews, and Apple definitely wants to reach young people. But I don&#8217;t get restricting real reviews to just three publications in the U.S. Leave me out of it, personally, just for the sake of argument here.</p>

<p>This is the most anticipated new device from Apple at least since the original iPad. People want to know about it. People are craving in-depth reviews. This is just unsatisfying.</p>

<p>(A thought that crossed my mind this week: What would Apple have done if Walt Mossberg hadn&#8217;t retired earlier this year?)</p>

<p>Andrew Webster, writing for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nintendo’s first mobile game, Super Mario Run, was enormously
popular &#8212; but that doesn’t mean it was a success for the company.
During <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2017/171031_2e.pdf">its most recent earnings report</a>, Nintendo revealed that
Mario Run has been downloaded 200 million times, 90 percent of
which came from outside of Japan. However, Nintendo says that
despite these big numbers, the game has “not yet reached an
acceptable profit point.” While Nintendo didn’t reveal any
specifics with regards to conversion rates, a big sticking point
for many with Super Mario Run was its comparatively large price
point; it’s free to download, but requires a one-time fee of $9.99
to unlock the whole game.</p>

<p>In contrast, Fire Emblem Heroes &#8212; which utilizes a more typical
free-to-play structure, with plentiful microtransactions &#8212; <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2017/171031_2e.pdf">has
been a much more lucrative title for Nintendo</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d love to know Nintendo&#8217;s conversion rate on the $9.99 in-app purchase. It must be pretty low for 200 million downloads not to be profitable enough.</p>

<p>Paul Thurrott:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an astonishing turn of events, Apple has secretly told the
press that iPhone X facial recognition will not work well. So you
can pre-order an iPhone X on Friday if you want. But you may want
to hold off a bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He thinks Apple leaked <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/10/face_id_fud">last week&#8217;s Face ID story</a> to Bloomberg, on purpose, to set expectations low for Face ID. That&#8217;s&#8230; a theory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you may know, the facial scanner in the iPhone X is based on
the technology that Microsoft first used, disastrously, in its
Xbox Kinect sensor. This probably explains why it works so poorly:
If Microsoft could never perfect this in a relatively huge device,
how could Apple’s component makers ever fit the technology into “a
space a few centimeters across and millimeters deep”?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, how could the company that got a stripped down version of OS X running on a cell phone in 2007 ever pull this off?</p>

<p>Mike Allen, writing for Axios:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My nephew Anders texted me an animated dog &#8212; an Animoji, from the
same family as the alien you see above &#8212; that said, in the
19-year-old&#8217;s voice and with his facial tilt: &#8220;Hey, Uncle Mike,
it&#8217;s me!&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew Anders had figured out to set up the iPhone X (&#8220;10&#8221;) that
Apple loaned me ahead of its release in stores this Friday.
Preorders for the $999 &#8220;future of the smartphone&#8221; began last
Friday in 55+ countries. (The Animoji choices include unicorn, pig
and panda.)</p>

<p>Anders, a college freshman, is our family&#8217;s designated early
adopter (he followed 4G blogs long before the fast broadband
rolled out nationally), and a longtime Apple connoisseur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank god Apple seeded Mike Allen with an iPhone X review unit. Such great insight from his fucking nephew, the emoji expert.</p>

<p>Steven Levy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve had this phone since last Tuesday. Apple had given me this
early peek in part because <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/iphone-tenth-anniversary/">I was one of the first pre-release
reviewers of the original iPhone</a>. Given <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/first-look-test-driving-iphone-102625">that history</a>, we
all thought it would be interesting to get my impressions of what
the company clearly believes is the next milestone in a journey
that has pretty much altered our relationship with technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting first look, but none of the other reviewers of the original iPhone had reviews of the iPhone X today. Mossberg is retired, but David Pogue and Ed Baig aren&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Jason Snell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the fate of the iPhone 8. It will be ignored by many of
Apple’s most committed followers, who see it as a speed bump on
the road to the release of the iPhone X in early November.
Instead, it will soldier on, doing its job as the latest iteration
of the existing iPhone line, providing a substantial upgrade to
people who haven’t bought an iPhone in two or three years and
aren’t interested in paying $999 for the very first generation of
a new iPhone, if they could even find one in stores. These people
are ready for a better version of their existing phone, and the
iPhone 8 will deliver that to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a month I&#8217;m kind of <em>meh</em> about Qi charging. As Snell notes, you have to put it on the pad just so, and it can move off the sweet spot when the phone vibrates from notifications. I&#8217;m hoping Apple&#8217;s own AirPower pad works better than the Belkin dingus I got to test.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something to be said for taking your time with a review, letting the experience settle in before writing about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the
charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>

<p>“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the
hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was up to order when it went live last night. My wife&#8217;s order went through with a delivery date of &#8220;November 17-24&#8221; after about 10 minutes of force-quitting/relaunching the iOS Apple Store app; my order went through a few minutes later, with delivery slipping to &#8220;December 5-11&#8221;.</p>

<p>Even today, though, orders are still only 5-6 weeks out. I was worried supply would be so tight that they&#8217;d be into January by now.</p>

<p>Amy Brittain and Drew Harwell, reporting for The Washington Post: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In recent years, the private prison company GEO Group has held its
annual leadership conference at venues near its Boca Raton
headquarters. But this year, the company moved its gathering to a
Miami-area golf resort owned by President Trump.</p>

<p>The event last week, during which executives and wardens gathered
for four days of meetings, dinner receptions and golf outings at
the luxurious 800-acre Trump National Doral, followed an intense
effort by GEO Group to align itself with the president and his
administration.</p>

<p>Melissa Chan, reporting for Time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rosamaria was being rushed to a hospital for emergency gall
bladder surgery early Tuesday when she was stopped at a Border
Patrol checkpoint east of Laredo and detained. U.S. Customs and
Border Protection agents &#8220;escorted&#8221; Rosamaria to a Corpus Christi
hospital to have her operation, the agency said in a statement.
After becoming medically cleared, Rosamaria was taken to a federal
facility for refugees in San Antonio on Wednesday and processed,
officials said.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been crying. She knows her mom is not there,&#8221;
Galvez said.</p>

<p>Another story, by Yale senior Viviana Andazola Marquez, writing in The New York Times, &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/opinion/ice-detained-father-yale.html">I Accidentally Turned My Dad In to Immigration Services</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people can’t wait to turn 21 so that they can drink. For me,
it was the day I could finally petition the government to change
my dad’s immigration status. I filed the paperwork in February and
believed it would be the beginning of sleeping easier at night, of
not worrying about “la migra” every time the phone rang.</p>

<p>Eight months later, my father and I showed up at the immigration
services office with our lawyer and notebooks full of supporting
documents. The officer told us our petition should be approved,
but not that day. We took this as an indication of another waiting
period, but we remained upbeat: The officer told my father how to
learn about his rights as a lawful permanent resident and
acknowledged that he had paid the appropriate fees.</p>

<p>After the officer left the room several times, something changed
in her demeanor, and the air in the room became thick with
mounting uncertainty. She asked me to leave. I didn’t want to, so
she turned to my father and asked him to tell me to leave. I told
myself I was just being paranoid and walked outside. As I waited,
three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents came in and took
custody of my dad.</p>

<p>When our lawyer reappeared, the look on his face told me
everything I needed to know. The world felt ripped from under
my feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ICE, under Trump, is a terrorist organization.</p>

<p>Jeff Williams, speaking in Taiwan at the 30th anniversary ceremony of TSMC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nature of the way Apple does business is we put all of our
energy into our new products, and we launch them, and if we were
to bet heavily on TSMC, there would be no backup plan. You can not
double plan the kind volumes that we do. We want leading edge
technology, but we want it at established technology kind of
volumes.</p>

<p>Rene Ritchie, responding to this piece at Wired positing that iOS 11&#8217;s Core ML machine learning engine could be a privacy problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  <p>For an example of where that could go wrong, think of a photo
filter or editing app that you might grant access to your
albums. With that access secured, an app with bad intentions
could provide its stated service, while also using Core ML to
ascertain what products appear in your photos, or what
activities you seem to enjoy, and then go on to use that
information for targeted advertising.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also nothing to do with Core ML. Smart spyware would try to
convince you to give it all your photos right up front. That way
it wouldn&#8217;t be limited to preconceived models or be at risk of
removal or restriction. It would simply harvest all your data and
then run whatever server-side ML it wanted to, whenever it
wanted to.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the way Google, Facebook, Instagram, and similar
photo services that run targeted ads against those services
already work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To present Core ML as a privacy risk is talking about a hypothetical risk while Google and Facebook are currently ransacking your privacy.</p>

	<summary type="text">If Apple had really been dithering over Touch ID-embedded-in-the-display vs. Face ID in June of this year, iPhone X wouldn’t be hitting the market until 2018. And the final decisions on the hardware for the iPhones that *will* be debuting next year are being made right now.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Seemingly-sensational Apple story from Bloomberg today, reported by Alex Webb and Sam Kim, &#8220;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-25/inside-apple-s-struggle-to-get-the-iphone-x-to-market-on-time">Inside Apple’s Struggle to Get the iPhone X to Market on Time</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of early fall, it was clearer than ever that production
problems meant Apple Inc. wouldn’t have enough iPhone Xs in time
for the holidays. The challenge was how to make the sophisticated
phone &#8212; with advanced features such as facial recognition &#8212; in
large enough numbers.</p>

<p>As Wall Street analysts and fan blogs watched for signs that the
company would stumble, Apple came up with a solution: It quietly
told suppliers they could reduce the accuracy of the
face-recognition technology to make it easier to manufacture,
according to people familiar with the situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds terrible. But what exactly does it mean? Does it mean Face ID will create too many false positives? Does it mean it will be too slow? Does it mean there will be too many false negatives? Surprise surprise, Bloomberg doesn&#8217;t say.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is famously demanding, leaning on suppliers and contract
manufacturers to help it make technological leaps and retain a
competitive edge. While a less accurate Face ID will still be far
better than the existing Touch ID, the company&#8217;s decision to
downgrade the technology for this model shows how hard it’s
becoming to create cutting-edge features that consumers are
hungry to try.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Downgraded technology&#8221; sounds terrible. But which components, exactly, were &#8220;downgraded&#8221;?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said “Bloomberg’s claim that it
reduced the accuracy spec for Face ID is completely false and we
expect Face ID to be the new gold standard for facial
authentication. The quality and accuracy of Face ID haven&#8217;t
changed; it continues to be one in a million probability of a
random person unlocking your iPhone with Face ID.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is extraordinary for Apple to issue a blanket &#8220;this is completely false&#8221; statement on any news story. Apple, as policy, no-comments every news story, even when they know it&#8217;s bullshit. So either this story is particularly strong bullshit, or Apple is lying, on the record, under one of their own real names (as opposed to the anonymous &#8220;an Apple spokesperson&#8221; attribution).</p>

<p>And what exactly is the point of Bloomberg&#8217;s story if, as reported, &#8220;Face ID will still be far better than the existing Touch ID&#8221;?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To make matters worse, Apple lost one of its laser suppliers early
on. Finisar Corp. failed to meet Apple’s specifications in time
for the start of production, and now the Sunnyvale,
California-based company is racing to meet the standards by the
end of October. That left Apple reliant on fewer laser suppliers:
Lumentum Holdings Inc. and II-VI Inc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/923314964349308928">Apple didn&#8217;t &#8220;lose&#8221; a supplier</a> &#8212; Apple <em>cut</em> the supplier because they weren&#8217;t producing adequate yields.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To boost the number of usable dot projectors and accelerate
production, Apple relaxed some of the specifications for Face ID,
according to a different person with knowledge of the process. As
a result, it took less time to test completed modules, one of the
major sticking points, the person said.</p>

<p>It’s not clear how much the new specs will reduce the technology’s
efficacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we get to the real heart of the story. Did Apple adjust the specifications for the components, or just the testing parameters? And if &#8220;it’s not clear how much the new specs will reduce the technology’s efficacy&#8221;, what is the point of this story? When did Apple &#8220;relax&#8221; these specifications? Before or after the September event?</p>

<p>To be clear, I have no idea whether Face ID works as advertised or not. I haven&#8217;t used it even once yet. Maybe it stinks, maybe it&#8217;s great, maybe it&#8217;s somewhere in between. But Bloomberg clearly doesn&#8217;t know either, yet they published this story which has a headline and summary &#8212; &#8220;The company let suppliers reduce accuracy of the phone’s Face ID system to speed up production&#8221; &#8212; which suggests that Face ID is going to stink because Apple&#8217;s suppliers couldn&#8217;t get enough good components out the door. If this weren&#8217;t merely clickbait, they&#8217;d be able to say how well it actually works.</p>

<hr />

<p>Frankly, I don&#8217;t trust anything Bloomberg reports about iPhones any more. On July 3, they published this piece by Mark Gurman, &#8220;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-03/apple-said-to-test-3-d-face-scanning-to-unlock-next-iphone">Apple Tests 3-D Face Scanning to Unlock Next iPhone</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. is working on a feature that will let you unlock your
iPhone using your face instead of a fingerprint.</p>

<p>For its redesigned iPhone, set to go on sale later this year,
Apple is testing an improved security system that allows users to
log in, authenticate payments, and launch secure apps by scanning
their face, according to people familiar with the product. This is
powered by a new 3-D sensor, added the people, who asked not to be
identified discussing technology that’s still in development. The
company is also testing eye scanning to augment the system, one of
the people said.</p>

<p>The sensor’s speed and accuracy are focal points of the feature.
It can scan a user’s face and unlock the iPhone within a few
hundred milliseconds, the person said. It is designed to work even
if the device is laying flat on a table, rather than just close up
to the face. The feature is still being tested and may not appear
with the new device. However, the intent is for it to replace the
Touch ID fingerprint scanner, according to the person. An Apple
spokesman declined to comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple did in fact replace Touch ID with Face ID in the iPhone X, but the timing on Gurman&#8217;s story is wrong. They weren&#8217;t &#8220;testing&#8221; the viability of any of this in July. According to several trusted sources within Apple, including multiple engineers who worked directly on the iPhone X project, the decision to go &#8220;all-in on Face ID&#8221; (in the words of one source) was made over a year ago. Further, the design of the iPhone X hardware was &#8220;locked&#8221; &#8212; again, a source&#8217;s word &#8212; prior to January 2017. If I had to wager, I&#8217;d say it was locked a few months before the end of 2016. This was a nine-month-old decision that Bloomberg reported in the present tense.</p>

<p>Beyond Bloomberg, there are the slew of reports from various &#8220;analysts&#8221; that suggested Apple was still working to incorporate Touch ID into the iPhone X display as late as this summer.</p>

<p><a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/01/21/apple-expected-to-replace-touch-id-with-two-step-facial-fingerprint-bio-recognition-tech">Ming-Chi Kuo in January</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a note sent out to investors on Friday, and subsequently
obtained by AppleInsider, well-connected KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo
says he believes Apple is developing a new class of
bio-recognition technologies that play nice with &#8220;full-face,&#8221; or
zero-bezel, displays. Specifically, Kuo foresees Apple replacing
existing Touch ID technology with optical fingerprint readers, a
change that could arrive as soon as this year, as Apple is widely
rumored to introduce a full-screen OLED iPhone model this fall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By January of this year there were no plans to embed an &#8220;optical fingerprint reader&#8221; in the display of any Apple device this year. Apple did, of course, investigate ways to embed Touch ID sensors in edge-to-edge displays, but, again, those efforts were abandoned in favor of Face ID over a year ago.</p>

<p>Cowen and Company analyst Timoth Arcuri, on June 21 (of this year), under the AppleInsider headline &#8220;<a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/06/21/apple-still-undecided-on-fingerprint-tech-for-iphone-8-no-shipments-until-october">Apple Still Undecided on Fingerprint Tech for &#8216;iPhone 8&#8217;, No Shipments Until October</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OLED-embedded fingerprint technology for Apple&#8217;s &#8220;iPhone 8&#8221;
is &#8220;still being worked out,&#8221; an analyst claimed on Wednesday,
with the company only deciding on one of three options by the end
of June.</p>

<p>The one settled point appears to be that there won&#8217;t be a sensor
on the back of the phone, Cowen and Company&#8217;s Timothy Arcuri
indicated in a memo obtained by AppleInsider. The three options
include thinning the cover glass over a sensor area, creating a
pinhole through the glass for an optical or ultrasonic sensor, or
trying a &#8220;film&#8221; sensor integrated into the display, using either
capacitive or infrared technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, it turns out, was complete nonsense. Again, Apple was &#8220;all-in&#8221; on Face ID over a year ago. The idea that they were still &#8220;working this out&#8221; in June is a joke.</p>

<p><a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/08/04/apple-reportedly-nixes-plans-to-incorporate-under-glass-touch-id-in-iphone-8">And back to Ming-Chi Kuo, in August</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has decided against an embedded Touch ID solution for its
forthcoming &#8220;iPhone 8&#8221; handset, according to well-connected
analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, leaving the door open for competitor Samsung
to debut similar technology in next year&#8217;s Galaxy Note 9.</p>

<p>In a note to investors obtained by AppleInsider, Kuo says Apple
has &#8220;cancelled&#8221; plans to embed a fingerprint recognition solution
in the next-generation flagship iPhone. The analyst left embedded
Touch ID off a list of standout &#8220;iPhone 8&#8221; features published in
July, but did not indicate that Apple had abandoned the initiative
altogether.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with Gurman&#8217;s report in June, the problem here is with the timing, not the facts. By August of this year, this was a nearly year-old decision.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphones-summer-production-glitches-create-holiday-jitters-1504801636">in a September 7 report attributed to reporters &#8220;Yoko Kubota in Tokyo, Tripp Mickle in San Francisco, and Takashi Mochizuki  in Tokyo&#8221;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The production delays earlier this summer stemmed in part from
Apple’s decision to build new phones using organic light-emitting
diode, or OLED, screens similar to those used by rival Samsung
Electronics Co. At the same time, Apple decided to ditch the
physical home button that contains fingerprint sensors for
unlocking the device. Apple tried to embed the Touch ID function,
or fingerprint scanner, in the new display, which proved
difficult, the people familiar with the process said.</p>

<p>As deadlines approached, Apple eventually abandoned the
fingerprint scanner, the people said, and users will unlock the
phone using either an old-fashioned password or what is expected
to be a new facial-recognition feature. Nonetheless, precious time
was lost and production was put back by about a month, according
to people familiar with the situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I quote the two Tokyo datelines in the byline because I don&#8217;t think this information came from Apple. Again, my sources at Apple, directly familiar with the decision, have told me that they chose Face ID over a year ago because they were convinced it was better than Touch ID. Touch ID was not abandoned because it was difficult to embed in the display.</p>

<p>For good measure while I&#8217;m pouring out the claim chowder, here&#8217;s Zach Epstein, writing for BGR on July 20, &#8220;<a href="http://bgr.com/2017/07/20/iphone-8-release-date-soon-leaks-touch-id-scoop/">I Might Know the Truth About Touch ID on Apple’s iPhone 8</a>&#8221; (note that the device he refers to as &#8220;iPhone 8&#8221; is the iPhone X):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have now received information from three different well-placed
sources over the past few weeks, and they have all told me the
same thing: The iPhone 8’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor is in the
power button.</p>

<p>The news first came to me about a month ago from a source I know
well. I’ve since been told the same thing by two additional
sources I haven’t known for quite as long. All three sources have
provided information to me in the past that has proven to be
accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;well-placed sources&#8221; for a bullshit story.</p>

<hr />

<p>All of this fits with what I&#8217;ve heard from rank-and-file engineering sources within Apple for years. To wit, producing hardware at the iPhone&#8217;s scale, while pushing the boundaries of the industry in technology, is so difficult, so complicated, that it requires hardware designs to be locked down <em>far</em> in advance of when iPhones are actually announced and released. Apple&#8217;s iPhone hardware engineering teams did not spend 2017 working on the iPhone X and iPhone 8 &#8212; they spent this year working on new iPhone hardware for 2018 and 2019 (and perhaps beyond). Hardware is nothing like software. If Apple had really been dithering over Touch ID-embedded-in-the-display vs. Face ID in June of this year, iPhone X wouldn&#8217;t be hitting the market until 2018. And the final decisions on the hardware for the iPhones that <em>will</em> be debuting next year are being made right now.</p>

<p>So where do these rumors come from? I don&#8217;t know. My guess is that if there&#8217;s an intent behind them, it&#8217;s that competitors (<em>cough</em>, Samsung?) within the Asian supply chain are attempting to sow doubt about Face ID. The narrative presented by analysts and certain news reports this summer was that Apple was still scrambling to get Touch ID working embedded within the iPhone X display, suggesting that Face ID was their Plan B.</p>

<p>People are naturally skeptical about biometric ID systems. They were skeptical about Touch ID when it was still only rumored, just like they&#8217;re skeptical now about Face ID. Today, though, Touch ID is both trusted and familiar. So rumors claiming that Apple really wanted to get Touch ID into iPhone X but had to settle for Face ID play into both the skepticism of the new and the comfort of the familiar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a> is one of the oldest tricks in the book.</p>

<p>The other, simpler explanation is that it simply takes 9 months or longer for engineering decisions made within Apple to percolate out to the rumor reporters and analysts &#8212; and their sources are so far removed from the halls of Cupertino that they mistake old news for new news.</p>

<p>Max Boot, writing for Foreign Policy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It becomes ever harder to disagree with the verdict of
foreign-policy sage Robert Kagan, like me an erstwhile Republican,
who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/faster-steve-bannon-kill-kill/2017/10/11/77bdf5c2-aea7-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?utm_term=.d7e73d3c8050">writes</a> that the GOP in its current form is doomed and that
Republicans who cannot stomach Trumpism “should change their
registration and start voting for Democratic moderates and
centrists, as some Republicans did in Virginia recently, to give
them a leg up in their fight against the party’s left wing.” As
I’ve explained <a href="http://atfp.co/2hik9QI">before</a>, I have my qualms about the Democratic
Party, which is lurching to the left, but I am done, done, done
with the GOP after more than 30 years as a loyal Republican.</p>

<p>This is truly Trump’s party, and that leaves me to root for
Democrats to win a landslide victory in the midterm elections next
fall. I have my differences with many Democratic candidates, but
on the most important issue facing our nation &#8212; whether Trump is
fit for office &#8212; they are right and Republicans are a disgrace.</p>

I don&#8217;t want websites to have access to <em>any</em> sensors on my machine. The good news is it doesn&#8217;t matter what Chrome and Mozilla do &#8212; I doubt there&#8217;s any way that Safari would allow access to this sensor without the user&#8217;s explicit permission.</p>

<p>Ingrid Lunden, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The advances point to how Apple wants to steal a march when it
comes to using phones as a proxy for a card or cash, and there is
some anecdotal evidence that it’s working: merchants and others
who have partnered with Apple say that Apple Pay is accounting for
90 percent of all mobile contactless transactions globally in
markets where it’s available.</p>

<p>“Apple Pay is the future of everyday spend,” said Bailey on stage
at the Money 20/20 conference that kicked off in Las Vegas
yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>90 percent market share for all mobile payments is rather remarkable for the platform with second-place market share overall.</p>

	<summary type="text">It’s not enough to make a better set-top box. It has to be *obviously* better. I don’t think Apple TV 4K makes that case.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From Shannon Liao&#8217;s roundup for The Verge of yesterday&#8217;s Amazon announcements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon Fire TV has had 4K support for a while, but a new device
will now support 4K HDR video with 2160p resolution at 60 frames
per second. It has Dolby Atmos integration and an Alexa voice
remote. It costs $70; that makes it priced far lower than the
rival Apple TV 4K, which starts at $179. The Fire TV is available
for preorder now and will come out on October 25th.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lack of Dolby Atmos support in the Apple TV 4K <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/thoughts_on_apple_tv_4k">was a sticking point in several reviews</a>. Atmos support is supposedly coming to Apple TV in a software update, though, so the obvious difference between these products is price.</p>

<p>Without ever having looked at the new Fire TV (I did pre-order one, though, so I can), I&#8217;m sure that Apple TV is a more powerful device. The new Fire TV doesn&#8217;t even have a power cord &#8212; it just <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/913215781227307008">dangles as a dongle</a> plugged into an HDMI port. [<strong>Update:</strong> I was wrong about this &#8212; it does take power, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonarogers/status/913481370910916608">with an ungainly micro-USB cable</a>. Boo-hiss to Amazon for not using USB-C.] But explain the difference to a typical person looking for a set-top box. Apple TV 4K&#8217;s main feature is obviously 4K playback &#8212; it&#8217;s right there in the name. The new Fire TV does 4K (with HDR at 60 FPS) too. Even.</p>

<p>Earlier this week I wrote about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/09/26/gates-android">my vague concern about Apple&#8217;s insular culture</a>. Apple TV is the product line where I think that might really be a problem. Apple charges a significant premium over the average product in PCs, tablets, and phones. It works for them in those markets. That&#8217;s what Apple does and has always done: they make superior, premium products for people willing to pay for them.</p>

<p>But with Apple TV, I&#8217;m hearing from a lot of people who are in the Apple ecosystem &#8212; people who own MacBooks, iPads, and iPhones &#8212; who just don&#8217;t want to spend $200 for an Apple TV when they can get a Roku or Fire TV for a lot less. The primary selling point of an Apple TV over these devices is iTunes. I love iTunes &#8212; I&#8217;ve bought hundreds of movies and TV series from iTunes over the years, knowing full well these purchases would be locked to the Apple ecosystem. I feel like my loyalty to iTunes is being rewarded now that I can get 4K versions of the movies I&#8217;ve already bought without paying another dime. No one sent me Blu-ray versions of the many movies I purchased on DVDs back in the day.</p>

<p>But for people who don&#8217;t buy movies from iTunes &#8212; and generally don&#8217;t buy movies period, choosing only to stream from Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Amazon Prime, etc. (and/or to assemble their home movie collection from copies that fall off trucks) &#8212; what does Apple TV offer to justify costing over twice as much? The computing power of the device and the popularity of iOS for gaming make Apple TV a decent casual gaming device, but it doesn&#8217;t ship with a gaming controller and even Apple describes Apple TV as a video platform first, gaming platform second.</p>

<p>I like Apple TV a lot, but I think Apple is ceding marketshare by not having a box that competes on price. I think there are a lot of people who look at iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks and see them as &#8220;expensive but worth it&#8221; but who look at Apple TV and see it as &#8220;ridiculously overpriced&#8221;.</p>

<p>Apple still sells the previous generation Apple TV, but it costs $149 and doesn&#8217;t support 4K. There are ways that it&#8217;s a better computer than a Fire TV or a Roku, but without 4K and HDR it&#8217;s inarguably worse at the primary task of playing back video content. The fact that it&#8217;s a more powerful computer is irrelevant. And yet it costs twice as much.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not enough to make a better set-top box. It has to be <em>obviously</em> better. I don&#8217;t think Apple TV&#8217;s current lineup makes that case.</p>

	<summary type="text">The reviews of iPhone X will be the most anticipated since the reviews of the original iPhone in 2007. But if you want an iPhone X before 2018, I suspect you’re going to have to pre-order before you read them.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Uncertainties-for-iPhone-X-production-over-3-D-sensor-issues">Debby Wu, reporting for Nikkei Asian Review</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two executives working for iPhone suppliers told Nikkei Asian
Review that makers of 3-D sensor parts are still struggling to
reach a satisfactory level of output, and to boost their yield
rate. [&#8230;] Both sources were unable to offer clarity on whether
Apple could meet demand after launch of the iPhone X. One said the
phone was being produced in small quantities, around tens of
thousands daily.</p>

<p>Jeff Pu, an analyst at Taipei-based Yuanta Investment Consulting,
also identified the 3-D sensors as the only major issue remaining.
[&#8230;] According to Pu&#8217;s estimate, Foxconn churned out 2 million
units of the iPhone X in September, and in October that number
should rise to 10 million. He said that Foxconn will have
assembled a total of 40 million iPhone X phones by year-end, lower
than his estimate of 45 million earlier this year.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supply will still be tight after Nov. 3,&#8221; Pu noted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should come as no surprise. When an Apple product is late, supply is constrained when it ships. The two go hand-in-hand. AirPods didn&#8217;t ship until December last year, and they were deliverable in &#8220;4-6 weeks&#8221; until earlier this month. Apple Watch shipped late, and supply was severely constrained for months.</p>

<p>This makes pre-ordering iPhone X a bit of a gamble. I do not know when Apple is going to seed review units of iPhone X. My guess, though, based on how they&#8217;ve seeded review units in the past, is that they&#8217;ll go out the week before pre-orders begin. The dates Apple has announced are Friday October 27 for pre-orders, and Friday November 3 for &#8220;available&#8221;. So my guess is that review units will go out on October 23 or 24 (Monday or Tuesday). But the embargo on reviews will probably end Monday or Tuesday the next week, October 30 or 31 &#8212; <em>after</em> pre-orders begin.<sup id="fnr1-2017-09-27"><a href="#fn1-2017-09-27">1</a></sup></p>

<p>If supplies are going to be severely constrained, that means you’ll have to place your pre-order Thursday night at midnight PT (3 am here on the east coast) if you want it delivered any time soon. I think it&#8217;s going to be the case that you&#8217;ll have to get lucky and get your order in within the first few minutes of it going on sale to get yours on November 3. Within minutes, I&#8217;ll bet shipping dates will slip to December. If you wait until you read the reviews the next week, you might be waiting until January for delivery.<sup id="fnr2-2017-09-27"><a href="#fn2-2017-09-27">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The embargo date for reviews has always come <em>after</em> pre-orders begin in my experience, and I don&#8217;t think that will change for iPhone X. But with iPhone X, I think people are a little bit more on the fence because so much is new. Does Face ID really work so well that you won&#8217;t miss Touch ID? Is the swipe from bottom gesture really a good replacement for the home button? Is moving Control Center from the bottom to the top right corner a good idea (especially on a 5.8-inch display)? Has Apple really made an OLED display with the color accuracy we expect from an Apple product? Personally, I&#8217;d like answers to all these questions before I order one. If the answer to any of these questions is <em>no</em>, it&#8217;s a problem. If the answer to several of these questions is <em>no</em>, it&#8217;s a disaster. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s likely, but it&#8217;s within the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>The reviews of iPhone X will be the most anticipated since the reviews of the original iPhone in 2007.<sup id="fnr3-2017-09-27"><a href="#fn3-2017-09-27">3</a></sup> But if you want an iPhone X before 2018, I suspect you&#8217;re going to have to pre-order before you read them. This won&#8217;t be <em>that</em> much of a gamble though: if you pre-order and the subsequent reviews give you pause, you should be able to cancel your order.</p>

<p>The smarter move, though, might be to let the phone ship anyway and resell it. However the reviews turn out, the gray market for iPhone X is going to be insane.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>

<li id="fn1-2017-09-27">
<p>I can speculate about these dates now because I don&#8217;t have an iPhone X review unit. But once I do, I&#8217;ll be under an NDA and won&#8217;t be able to talk about it. Apple&#8217;s NDA for review units doesn&#8217;t permit you to say anything about the product until the embargo drops.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2017-09-27"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn2-2017-09-27">
<p>If the number of iPhone X units available on day one is anywhere in the ballpark of only 12 million, that won&#8217;t even come close to meeting demand here in the U.S. alone. But keep in mind that <em>a lot</em> of these <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-lessons-and-questions-of-the-iphone-x-and-the-iphone-8/">are likely going to China</a>, where iPhone sales have been slumping and the &#8220;status item&#8221; aspect of iPhone X could be a huge factor in turning that around.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2017-09-27"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

	<summary type="text">There is a future for wearable devices that don’t have displays. AirPods are part of that future; a jacket with a Bluetooth remote in the sleeve, not so much.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2017/09/25/google-levis-jacquard-jacket-review/">Karissa Bell, writing for Mashable</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After more than two years of testing, Jacquard, the company&#8217;s
project to embed technology into clothes, is ready to launch.
The Levi’s Commuter Trucker Jacket with Jacquard by Google
(yes, that&#8217;s actually what it&#8217;s called), is now on sale in
select stores.</p>

<p>And while it&#8217;s easy to roll your eyes at the idea of a $350 jacket
that comes with its own app, Jacquard is more than a gimmick.
After a few days of wearing Levi&#8217;s Jacquard jacket, I&#8217;m more
convinced than ever that the future of wearable tech lies not in
tiny screens on our wrists, but in the stuff we&#8217;re already
wearing. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Which gets at one of the other appeals of <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/05/30/project-jacquard-analysis-google/">reinventing wearables as
actual clothes</a>: convenience. One of my <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/04/13/smartwatches-are-so-doomed/">biggest issues with
smartwatches</a> is that glancing at a tiny screen on your wrist isn&#8217;t
actually that much better that just pulling out your phone.</p>

<p>Limited though Jacquard&#8217;s abilities currently are, at least I
don&#8217;t need to look at a screen to take advantage of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree completely. First, this jacket isn&#8217;t really a wearable piece of technology. There are touch sensors on the sleeve cuff, yes, but most of the technology is in a flexible gadget that they&#8217;re calling a &#8220;tag&#8221;, which is about the size of an Apple TV remote and which you holster in the underside of the sleeve. It&#8217;s not a smart jacket so much as a jacket designed with a custom sleeve to hold the smart device. But even the device itself isn&#8217;t all that smart. It&#8217;s not a fitness tracker. I&#8217;m hard pressed to come up with a more generous description of it than &#8220;a Bluetooth remote control&#8221;.</p>

<p>Bell&#8217;s &#8220;biggest issues with smartwatches&#8221; is a link to a piece Bell wrote earlier this year, under the headline &#8220;<a href="http://mashable.com/2017/04/13/smartwatches-are-so-doomed/">It&#8217;s Time to Stop Pretending Smartwatches Are Useful in Any Way</a>&#8221;. One can certainly argue that smartwatches were overhyped, but it&#8217;s preposterous to argue they&#8217;re not useful at all. Apple Watch in particular is terrific for fitness tracking and for showing notifications &#8212; neither of which things this jacket can do.</p>

<p>The only features of this jacket that Bell (or Google, <a href="https://www.blog.google/topics/atap/more-just-jacket-levis-commuter-trucker-jacket-powered-jacquard-technology/">in their own post announcing its release</a>) cites are about audio control. Here&#8217;s Google&#8217;s own list of features:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>Play or pause your music, skip to the next track, or ask what song
is playing.</p></li>
<li><p>Get your next direction, ETA, or the current time.</p></li>
<li><p>Receive updates on incoming call or texts with a subtle LED
light and a vibration on your sleeve, and have the text message
read to you.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless I&#8217;m missing something, if you don&#8217;t have headphones in and your phone with you, this jacket does nothing other than keep you warm. It&#8217;s a glorified remote control for audio playback and talking to Google Assistant. It&#8217;s no smarter than the little clicker on the earbuds that come with every phone.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s great not to have to look at a display to use a device. That&#8217;s why Apple Watch has haptic feedback. But you know what else is great? Being able to look at a display when you want to. You can wear a watch every day, in all weather conditions. And you keep it on all day. A jacket is something you wear in specific weather conditions and generally take off once you get inside. I don&#8217;t see how this is better than a smartwatch in any way.</p>

<p>And this jacket looks even worse compared to AirPods. You need to have headphones in for any of the jacket&#8217;s features, so why not just buy smart headphones instead? They work every day, with every outfit you wear (including while you work out).</p>

<p>There is a future for wearable devices that don&#8217;t have displays. AirPods are part of that future; a jacket with a Bluetooth remote in the sleeve, not so much.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been testing the new Apple TV 4K for a few days, but I don&#8217;t own a 4K TV, so there&#8217;s no way I can pretend to write a full-on review when I can&#8217;t make use of the tentpole new feature. I do have a few thoughts, though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Initial setup was amazingly simple. Plug it in, it boots up quickly, and it asks if you want to share setup information like your Wi-Fi network info from your iPhone. Hold your iPhone near the Apple TV and boom, Apple TV is on your network, and it knows some information like your iTunes Apple ID. This is true too for setting up a new iOS 11 device &#8212; you can get a headstart on setting up a new iPhone just by holding your old iPhone next to it. But this is especially helpful on Apple TV, where entering passwords and email addresses through the on-screen keyboard felt like a form of punishment. When you do need to type things, Siri dictation works like a charm &#8212; fast and accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>It is baffling to me that Apple didn&#8217;t redesign the remote control to make it obvious at a touch which way it&#8217;s oriented. The raised white ring around the Menu button is an improvement, but it&#8217;s truly the least Apple could have done. I really wish they&#8217;d either made it asymmetric (wedge-shaped, perhaps) or used texture to denote orientation along the back and sides. Nobody loves this remote. Most people I know outright dislike it. And Apple left it almost unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>It seems to me that navigating around the Apple TV 4K interface is improved over the previous generation. Everything feels snappier, Siri seems to be faster and more accurate, and even navigation via the remote control feels more accurate. I&#8217;m not sure if that last one is thanks to improvements in the Apple TV 4K hardware itself, improvements to the remote control touchpad, improvements to tvOS 11, the reviewer&#8217;s placebo effect (I <em>want</em> navigation to be more precise), or some combination of the above. My guess is that it&#8217;s a change to tvOS to change the on-screen physics of navigation.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple TV 4K is tiny compared to a Mac Mini, but judging by Geekbench scores (<a href="http://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/search?dir=desc&amp;q=mac+mini&amp;sort=score">Mac Mini</a>; <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/search?dir=desc&amp;q=ipad+pro&amp;sort=score">iPad Pro</a>, which uses the A10X in the Apple TV<sup id="fnr1-2017-09-21"><a href="#fn1-2017-09-21">1</a></sup>) it&#8217;s a slightly faster computer than even the maxed-out Mac Mini configuration. Apple TV 4K probably has better GPU performance too. In addition to all the performance problems stemming from the fact that the Mac Mini hasn&#8217;t been updated in three years, it&#8217;s also inarguable that it&#8217;s no longer even &#8220;mini&#8221;. You could arrange four Apple TV units in a 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;2 square and they&#8217;d take up the same volume as one Mac Mini.</p></li>
<li><p>I did get to see Apple TV 4K in action last week in California, in a product briefing with Apple. They had it connected to a gorgeous 70-inch display from LG. Apple&#8217;s remastered videos for the Aerial screensaver look amazing. There&#8217;s a daytime flyover in Dubai in which you can now see that one of the skyscrapers has a pool on the roof with two sharks in it. It&#8217;s on the left-hand side of the street. That&#8217;s some serious James Bond villain&#8217;s lair shit.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade advice: I often don&#8217;t give upgrade advice in reviews, because everyone&#8217;s situation is different. Instead, I try to write reviews that help <em>you</em> decide on your own whether it&#8217;s worth upgrading to this new thing from whatever you&#8217;re using now. But with Apple TV 4K, upgrade advice for people who already own the previous Apple TV is easy. If you have a 4K TV, you should upgrade (especially if you watch a lot of movies and TV shows from iTunes). If you don&#8217;t own a 4K TV, you shouldn&#8217;t.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In short, it&#8217;s the Apple TV you know and love (and/or hate), only faster, and with 4K support I can&#8217;t test.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017">Nilay Patel&#8217;s Review for The Verge</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is firmly at the high end of the market: the Apple TV 4K
starts at $179, much more than competing 4K HDR-capable devices
like the $89 Roku Premiere+ or the $69 Google Chromecast Ultra. I
was really expecting &#8212; <em>hoping!</em> &#8212; this thing would blow me away.</p>

<p>But the new Apple TV doesn’t support Atmos. And it doesn’t support
YouTube in 4K HDR. And it doesn’t have Disney or Marvel movies in
4K HDR. And it makes some 1080p content look less than great.</p>

<p>I’m going to explain why these limitations exist, but you’ll have
to bear with me. I suspect most reviewers will focus on the
interface, the TV app and the various content deals that populate
it, and the bare fact that the Apple TV now supports 4K HDR
playback. But I need to tell you about video format arcana,
because Apple’s decisions around some very wonky specs directly
influence what it’s like to use the new Apple TV 4K.</p>

<p>Put some tape on your glasses. This is going to be nerdy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great review, and I really enjoyed the focus on the technical aspects. In terms of user-interface, Apple TV is clearly the best, because Apple is the only company in the game that values the user experience so highly. (<a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/910890071779196928">Matthew Panzarino</a>: &#8220;Interface and OS still best in class. All other TV box interfaces are like sticking a fork in your eye and swizzling it around.&#8221;)</p>

<p>The omission of <a href="https://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-atmos.html">Atmos</a> support seems baffling. As Patel points out, for the premium price Apple charges &#8212; at $179 for the 32 GB model, it&#8217;s double the price a Roku Premium Plus &#8212; you expect support for premium features like Atmos. According to Patel, though, <a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/910822732287356928">Atmos support is coming in a future update</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the lack of 4K YouTube support plays out. The issue is that YouTube encodes its 4K content using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP9">the VP9 codec</a>. No Apple device supports this format. Apple has thrown its weight behind H.265.</p>

<p>With regular HD content, YouTube supports H.264. If YouTube dropped H.264 support for HD content, you couldn&#8217;t play HD YouTube videos on any Apple device. There&#8217;s no way YouTube is going to do that &#8212; the iOS market is too big and too valuable. And you don&#8217;t need 4K to play at native resolution on iPhones &#8212; HD is enough. And even on iPads, the displays are small enough that upscaled HD is still good. But on a 70-inch (or bigger) 4K display, 4K content matters.</p>

<p>Unlike the iPhone and iPad, Apple TV doesn&#8217;t have enough market share to force Google&#8217;s hand. I think Google can stick to its VP9 guns and it&#8217;ll be Apple that pays the price. YouTube&#8217;s enormous popularity is more likely to force Apple into supporting VP9 than the Apple TV&#8217;s middling popularity is to force YouTube into supporting H.265. Even worse for Apple, the whole point of Apple TV is that &#8212; like with all Apple products &#8212; its entire reason for existence is to provide a premium experience for discerning users. Apple TV users are more likely to notice and be annoyed by upscaled 1080p content on their 4K TV than users of generic set top boxes are.</p>

<p>Apple may well have good technical or legal reasons for not supporting VP9. Apple TV users don&#8217;t care. They just want YouTube videos to look great on their TVs.</p>

<p>Another non-ideal aspect of Apple TV 4K &#8212; rather than have your TV switch modes from 4K to 1080p when playing 1080p content, Apple TV upscales the 1080p on the fly itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have a previous Apple TV, this lack of mode switching is
familiar, but remapping SDR content into HDR is a whole new
ballgame, and unfortunately, Apple’s HDR video processing is hit
or miss. It was great when I watched HD content from iTunes, but
it fell down in other apps. I watched <em>The Dark Knight</em> in HD on HBO
Go with our video team, and the Apple TV 4K HDR processing blew
out all the contrast in the image, sharpened everything to hell,
and turned the film grain into noise. The same movie looked fine
on iTunes, but it just looked bad from HBO Go. I checked on my
older 1080p Apple TV, and HBO Go looked fine. So there’s
definitely work to be done here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/910895751923884032">Matthew Panzarino noted the same thing</a>, again, from content that wasn&#8217;t from the iTunes Store.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no Geekbench app for Apple TV, unfortunately. If anything, Apple TV 4K might be faster than iPad Pro, because iPad Pro runs on battery and Apple TV is always plugged in.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2017-09-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
